"Knowledge Transfer","High concentration of critical backend knowledge in a single developer.","Schedule mandatory pair programming sessions between `backend.dev1` and `backend.dev2` (once onboarded) for all security and core logic tasks. Enforce strict documentation standards for all Cloud Functions.","Reduces key person dependency risk by 50% and accelerates onboarding of the new hire.","32","8 weeks","Both backend developers are able to independently deploy and debug critical functions.","Avoids potential 4-week project delay, valued at over $50,000."
"QA Automation","Heavy reliance on manual testing for complex flows like offline sync and permissions.","Allocate 20% of QA capacity in Sprints 1-3 to building a foundational E2E test suite using Flutter's `integration_test` framework, focusing on the critical auth and attendance workflows.","Reduces regression testing time by 60% in later sprints and increases detection of critical bugs before release.","48","6 weeks","CI/CD pipeline runs a full E2E test suite on every pull request to the main branch.","Saves an estimated 100 hours of manual regression testing over the project lifecycle."
