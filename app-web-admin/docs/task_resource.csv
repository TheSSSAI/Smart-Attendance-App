"TASK-001-BE","Backend: Implement `registerOrganization` Cloud Function","Backend Development (TypeScript)","Firebase Functions,Firestore Transactions,Security","High","16","Senior","1.2","24","1","true","TASK-002-FE","true","Low","","Requires deep expertise in atomic Firestore transactions and setting custom claims securely. High risk of data inconsistency if not implemented correctly.","A mid-level developer could attempt this with mandatory pair programming with a senior, increasing hours by 50%.","Single point of failure on backend expertise. Incorrect implementation could lead to orphaned auth users or tenant data.","Mandatory peer review by another backend developer; comprehensive integration test suite using Firebase Emulator.","4.8","3.2","1.6","4","3"

Requires extensive physical device testing.","None. This is core functionality requiring specific mobile expertise.","Inconsistent GPS performance across different devices. Nuances in platform-specific permission handling.","Allocate a separate testing budget for a wide range of physical devices. Use a mature, well-supported location handling library.","7.2","3.6","1.8","6","4"

Testing all network failure scenarios is difficult.","Implement auxiliary tracking for sync status. Dedicate significant QA time to manual testing with network manipulation tools.","6","3","1.5","5","2"

Performance depends on correct index configuration.","Could denormalize subordinate names onto attendance records to avoid client-side joins, adding backend complexity.","Poorly configured indexes will lead to slow performance and high costs. Insecure rules could leak data between teams.","Backend team must define and deploy composite indexes before frontend work begins. Rigorous security rule testing is mandatory.","5.6","2.8","1.4","4","2"
