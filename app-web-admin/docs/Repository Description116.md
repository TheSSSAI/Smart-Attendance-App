# 3 Description

This repository contains the Flutter for Web application that serves as the administrative dashboard. It represents the web-facing part of the original 'attendance-app-client'. This application is exclusively for the 'Admin' user role and provides features for tenant configuration, comprehensive user and team management, viewing detailed reports, and managing the Google Sheets integration. It assembles the shared client libraries (data access, UI) to build a responsive web interface optimized for desktop and tablet viewports. By separating the admin web app, its development and deployment can be iterated on rapidly and independently of the mobile application's release schedule.

# 20.0.0 Decomposition Rationale

NEW_DECOMPOSED

## 20.2.0 Source Repository

REPO-CLIENT-001

## 20.3.0 Decomposition Reasoning

Separates the web-based Admin Dashboard from the mobile application. Web applications have a different deployment model (push to hosting vs. app store submission), different target devices (desktop/tablet), and serve a completely different user role (Admin). This split allows for rapid web deployments and a UX tailored for administrative tasks.

## 20.4.0 Extracted Responsibilities

- Admin-only features.
- User and Team management UIs.
- Reporting dashboards.
- Tenant configuration settings UI.

## 20.5.0 Reusability Scope

- N/A - This is a final, deployable application.

## 20.6.0 Development Benefits

- Enables continuous deployment for the web app.
- UX can be optimized for larger screens.
- Clear ownership for the administrative side of the product.
