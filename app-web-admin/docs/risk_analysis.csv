"RISK-001","Technical","A flaw in the Firestore Security Rules, the primary mechanism for data segregation, could lead to a critical multi-tenant data breach, allowing users from one organization to access data from another. This is the single most critical technical risk in the architecture.","3","5","15","High","All data access operations (read, write, update, delete) across the entire application. Specifically affects REQ-1-002, REQ-1-025, REQ-1-068.","Over-reliance on a single, complex ruleset for all data security and tenant isolation. A single logical error in the rules could have catastrophic consequences.","Mandate a 'deny-by-default' security posture. Implement a comprehensive, automated test suite for all Firestore Security Rules using the Firebase Emulator Suite, covering every role and data path. Require peer review of all security rule changes by a designated security lead.","In case of a breach, immediately deploy a restrictive, read-only ruleset to halt all data modification. Initiate incident response protocol, including tenant notification and data access audit using Firestore logs.","Security rule test suite failure in the CI/CD pipeline. Regular manual audits of security rules against documented access patterns.","Security Lead / Tech Lead","2025-02-15","Not Started"
"RISK-002","Quality","The offline synchronization logic for mobile clients is inherently complex. A bug in this system could lead to the silent loss of attendance data created offline, causing data integrity issues, user frustration, and requiring extensive manual correction.","4","4","16","High","Core attendance marking features (check-in/check-out). Affects REQ-1-009, REQ-1-046, US-033, US-034, US-035.","Difficulty in reliably tracking the age and state of writes in Firestore's opaque offline cache, combined with the challenge of testing various network failure and device state scenarios.","Implement a supplementary local database (e.g., Drift) to explicitly track metadata of unsynced records. Implement robust client-side logging of all sync attempts and failures to a remote service (Firebase Crashlytics). Dedicate significant QA resources to manual end-to-end testing of offline scenarios on physical devices.","If data loss is detected, Admins must use the direct data edit feature (US-050) to manually reconstruct records based on user reports. The persistent sync failure notification (US-035) serves as a user-level contingency.","Increase in specific error logs related to sync failures in Crashlytics. User reports of missing attendance records.","Mobile Lead","2025-03-01","Not Started"
"RISK-003","Operational","A bug in the automated, scheduled tenant data deletion function could lead to the catastrophic and irreversible deletion of the wrong tenant's data or premature deletion of data within the grace period. This would cause permanent data loss for a customer.","2","5","10","Medium","Tenant offboarding and data lifecycle management. Directly relates to REQ-1-035 and WI-002-01-06.","The destructive and irreversible nature of the operation, combined with the complexity of a scheduled, automated batch process.","The deletion function must run in 'dry-run' mode by default, logging what it would delete without actually deleting it. The function must re-verify the tenant's status ('pending_deletion') and grace period expiry inside a transaction before performing any writes. Require manual review and sign-off before enabling the function in production.","The only recovery mechanism is to restore the entire database from the last daily backup, leading to potential data loss for all tenants up to 24 hours. The 30-day grace period is itself a primary mitigation against accidental user action.","Configure a Google Cloud Monitoring alert for an abnormally high volume of Firestore delete operations.","Backend Lead / DevOps Lead","2025-03-15","Not Started"
"RISK-004","Technical","Reporting features, if implemented by querying raw attendance data on the client, will lead to poor performance and excessive Firestore read costs as tenant data grows, making the application slow and the business model financially unviable.","4","4","16","High","All administrative reporting features. Affects REQ-1-057, US-059, US-061, US-062, US-063.","The naive approach of fetching large datasets to the client for aggregation is easy to implement but does not scale with Firestore's pricing model or performance characteristics.","Mandate a server-side aggregation strategy for all reports. Use scheduled Cloud Functions (e.g., daily) to pre-calculate and store summary data in separate 'reporting' collections. The Admin dashboard will query these smaller, aggregated collections, ensuring fast load times and low read costs.","If a report is causing cost spikes, an emergency patch can be deployed to disable the feature or replace it with a more limited, less expensive query until the aggregation strategy can be implemented.","GCP Budget Alerts set at 50%, 75%, and 90% of the projected monthly spend. Spikes in Firestore read operations visible in the Firebase console.","Backend Lead / Architect","2025-02-28","Not Started"
"RISK-005","External","The project's heavy reliance on third-party Google APIs (Sheets, Maps) and SendGrid creates a risk of critical feature failure due to external API changes, outages, rate limiting, or significant pricing model adjustments.","3","4","12","Medium","User invitations, data export to Google Sheets, and location visualization. Affects REQ-1-008, REQ-1-014, US-005, US-065.","Delegation of core functionality to external services outside the project's control.","Encapsulate all external API interactions within a dedicated adapter/repository layer in the codebase to simplify future migrations or updates. Implement robust error handling, logging, and alerting for all external API calls. The Google Sheets export must queue and retry failed records.","For email, have a secondary provider (e.g., AWS SES) identified as a potential fallback. For Sheets/Maps, in case of a prolonged outage, disable the feature in the UI with an explanatory message.","Alerts on Cloud Function error rates for functions that specifically call these external APIs. A sudden increase in 4xx or 5xx errors from these endpoints.","Backend Lead","2025-03-31","Not Started"
"RISK-006","Technical","The requirement for data residency (REQ-1-024) introduces significant architectural complexity. An incorrect implementation could lead to a major compliance breach (e.g., GDPR) by storing data in the wrong geographic region, resulting in legal penalties and loss of enterprise customer trust.","3","5","15","High","The entire tenant creation and data storage architecture. Affects US-003 and the project's foundational setup.","High complexity of implementing a true multi-region architecture on GCP/Firebase, which is not a simple configuration switch.","Conduct a mandatory, time-boxed technical spike and architectural design review to validate the chosen multi-region strategy (e.g., project-per-region) before any implementation. The design must be signed off by senior leadership. Implement rigorous integration tests that provision a tenant in a specific region and verify data location via GCP APIs.","This is a fundamental architectural decision with no simple contingency plan post-launch. A failure would require a high-risk, complex data migration project. The entire focus must be on prevention and correct initial implementation.","During QA and pre-launch audits, manually verify the physical location of Firestore databases for test tenants created in different regions via the GCP console.","Architect / Tech Lead","2025-02-20","Not Started"
"RISK-007","Resource","The project requires a specialized and diverse skillset (Flutter for Web/Mobile, deep Firebase expertise, TypeScript, DevOps on GCP). A lack of expertise or the departure of a key team member in any of these areas could severely impact project velocity and quality.","3","4","12","Medium","All development and operational tasks.","Dependency on a niche, but powerful, technology stack and a small, highly skilled team.","Mandate pair programming on critical components like security rules and CI/CD pipelines. Enforce high-quality, up-to-date documentation for all architectural decisions and complex features. Budget for and encourage cross-training and professional development.","Establish relationships with pre-vetted external consulting firms specializing in Flutter/Firebase who can provide emergency support or staff augmentation if needed.","Regularly review the 'bus factor' for critical project areas during sprint retrospectives. Any area with a bus factor of 1 is an immediate trigger for cross-training.","Engineering Manager","2025-03-10","In Progress"
"RISK-008","Operational","A misconfiguration in the CI/CD pipeline could lead to deploying code to the wrong environment (e.g., staging to production), bypassing quality gates, or failing to deploy critical updates, thereby blocking the entire release process or causing a production incident.","3","5","15","High","All software releases and hotfixes. Relates to REQ-1-020 and WI-001-02-01.","Complexity of managing a multi-environment deployment pipeline as code, with environment-specific secrets and configurations.","Implement protected branches for `develop` and `main` in the Git repository. Require mandatory status checks (tests, linting, code coverage) to pass before any code can be merged. Use distinct, clearly named secrets and variables for each environment in GitHub Actions. Automate deployment notifications to a team channel.","Document and periodically rehearse a manual deployment procedure that can be executed by a senior engineer in the event of a catastrophic pipeline failure.","CI/CD build failures reported in GitHub Actions. Failure notifications in the team's chat channel.","DevOps Lead","2025-02-25","Not Started"
