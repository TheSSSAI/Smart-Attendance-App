## 1.1 Diagram Name

New Organization Tenant Registration Flow

## 1.2 Diagram Type

flowchart

## 1.3 Purpose

Documents the end-to-end process for a new Admin registering their organization, including real-time validation for organization name and password complexity, data residency selection, secure server-side atomic creation, and comprehensive error handling, based on user stories US-001, US-002, US-003, and US-027.

# 3.0 Diagram Elements

## 3.1 Actors Systems

- User (Prospective Admin)
- Frontend (Web Application)
- Backend (Firebase Cloud Function)
- Firebase Auth
- Firestore DB

## 3.2 Key Processes

- Real-time Validation (Org Name, Password)
- Data Residency Selection
- Atomic Tenant & User Creation
- Custom Claim Assignment
- Error Handling & Rollback

## 3.3 Decision Points

- Client-Side Validation
- Server-Side Input Validation
- Organization Name Uniqueness Check
- Atomic Transaction Commit/Fail

## 3.4 Success Paths

- User provides all valid, unique information, leading to successful tenant creation and redirection to the admin dashboard.

## 3.5 Error Scenarios

- User provides a duplicate organization name.
- User provides a password that fails complexity checks.
- User fails to select a data residency region.
- A server-side error occurs, triggering a transactional rollback.

## 3.6 Edge Cases Covered

- Race condition for organization name registration is handled by a transactional server-side check.
- Atomic creation ensures no orphaned data (e.g., an Auth user without a Firestore document) is left after a partial failure.

## 6.3 Maintenance Notes

Update this diagram if new fields are added to the registration form, if validation rules change, or if the backend atomic transaction logic is modified.

## 6.4 Integration Recommendations

Embed in the technical design document for the Onboarding epic, and link directly from the relevant user stories (US-001, US-002, US-003, US-027).
