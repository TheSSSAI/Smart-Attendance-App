# 3.0 Diagram Elements

## 3.1 Actors Systems

- User (Prospective Admin)
- Frontend Web App
- Backend (Cloud Function)
- Firebase Auth
- Firestore Database

## 3.2 Key Processes

- Client-side validation
- Server-side uniqueness check
- Atomic creation of Auth user, Tenant, and User documents
- Setting custom claims on Auth token
- Automatic login and role-based redirection

## 3.3 Decision Points

- Client-side validation pass/fail
- Organization name uniqueness
- Backend transaction success/fail
- Custom claims setting success/fail
- Client-side role check

## 3.4 Success Paths

- User provides unique, valid data and is successfully redirected to the admin dashboard.

## 3.5 Error Scenarios

- Inline validation errors (e.g., bad email format)
- Organization name is already taken
- Backend transaction fails, triggering a full rollback of created data
- User's role is not 'Admin' after login

## 3.6 Edge Cases Covered

- Race condition check for organization name uniqueness on the server.
- Atomic transaction with rollback ensures no orphaned data is created on partial failure.
