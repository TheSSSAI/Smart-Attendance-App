# 1 Diagram Info

## 1.1 Diagram Name

Supervisor Attendance Approval Flow

## 1.2 Diagram Type

sequenceDiagram

## 1.3 Purpose

Provides a comprehensive technical specification for the supervisor attendance approval business process. The sequence details how the Flutter mobile client securely queries and updates attendance records stored in the Firestore database, emphasizing indexed queries, batched writes for atomicity, and the role of Firestore Security Rules for RBAC.

## 1.4 Target Audience

- developers
- QA engineers
- system architects
- product managers

# 3.0 Diagram Elements

## 3.1 Actors Systems

- Supervisor's Mobile App (Flutter)
- Firestore Database

## 3.2 Key Processes

- Querying for pending records based on supervisor ID and status
- Rendering the approval queue in the UI
- Submitting an atomic batched write to approve/reject records
- Server-side authorization via Firestore Security Rules

## 3.3 Decision Points

- Supervisor selects records to action
- Supervisor chooses to 'Approve' or 'Reject'

## 3.4 Success Paths

- Supervisor successfully queries and views pending records
- Supervisor successfully submits a batch approval/rejection which is atomically committed to the database

## 3.5 Error Scenarios

- Firestore permission-denied error if rules are violated
- Network failure leading to offline queuing of the write operation
- A generic FirebaseException on write failure

## 3.6 Edge Cases Covered

- Offline submission of approvals/rejections
- Atomic updates for bulk actions to prevent data inconsistency
