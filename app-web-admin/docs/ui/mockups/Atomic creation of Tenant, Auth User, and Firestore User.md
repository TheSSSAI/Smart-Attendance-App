# 3.0 Diagram Elements

## 3.1 Actors Systems

- AdminWebDashboard
- CallableCloudFunction
- FirestoreDatabase
- FirebaseAuthentication

## 3.2 Key Processes

- Create Auth User
- Run Firestore Transaction (Create Tenant & User docs)
- Set Custom Claims
- Compensation Logic (Rollback)

## 3.3 Decision Points

- Name uniqueness check
- Firestore Transaction Success/Failure
- Set Custom Claims Success/Failure

## 3.4 Success Paths

- Full atomic creation of Auth user, Firestore documents, and custom claims.

## 3.5 Error Scenarios

- Organization name is already taken.
- Firestore transaction fails, leading to Auth user deletion.
- Setting custom claims fails, leading to deletion of all created resources.

## 3.6 Edge Cases Covered

- Handling of partial failures to prevent orphaned data (e.g., an Auth user with no corresponding Firestore document).
