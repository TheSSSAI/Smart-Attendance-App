# 3.0 Diagram Elements

## 3.1 Actors Systems

- User (Prospective Admin)
- Web Dashboard (Frontend)
- Validation Cloud Function
- Registration Cloud Function
- Firebase Authentication
- Firestore Database

## 3.2 Key Processes

- Client-side validation
- Asynchronous organization name uniqueness check
- Atomic creation of tenant and user data
- Setting of custom auth claims
- Compensation logic (rollback) for failed steps

## 3.3 Decision Points

- Client-side validation pass/fail
- Org name uniqueness check pass/fail
- Success/failure of Auth user creation
- Success/failure of Firestore transaction
- Success/failure of setting custom claims

## 3.4 Success Paths

- User provides valid, unique data and is successfully registered, logged in, and redirected to the dashboard.

## 3.5 Error Scenarios

- Invalid form inputs (email format, password complexity)
- Duplicate organization name is entered
- Failure at any backend creation step (Auth, Firestore, Claims)
- Network errors during validation or submission

## 3.6 Edge Cases Covered

- Race condition for organization name check (handled by re-validation on server)
- Rollback/compensation logic for partial failures to prevent orphaned data (e.g., an Auth user without a Firestore document)
