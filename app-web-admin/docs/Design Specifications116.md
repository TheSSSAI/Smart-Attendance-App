# 6.0.0.0.0 Sequence Analysis

## 6.1.0.0.0 Interaction Patterns

### 6.1.1.0.0 Sequence Name

#### 6.1.1.1.0 Sequence Name

Admin views a filtered report

#### 6.1.1.2.0 Repository Role

Initiator and Presenter

#### 6.1.1.3.0 Required Interfaces

- IAttendanceRepository
- IAuditLogRepository

#### 6.1.1.4.0 Method Specifications

- {'method_name': 'ref.watch(filteredReportProvider(filters))', 'interaction_context': 'When the user applies filters on a report screen.', 'parameter_analysis': "The 'filters' object contains parameters like date range, selected users/teams, and status.", 'return_type_analysis': "Returns an 'AsyncValue<List<ReportItem>>' which handles loading, data, and error states for the UI.", 'analysis_reasoning': 'This encapsulates the reactive data flow where a change in filter state automatically triggers a new data fetch and UI update, leveraging Riverpod for state management.'}

#### 6.1.1.5.0 Analysis Reasoning

This pattern is fundamental for the reporting module (US-059, US-060), ensuring a responsive UI that delegates complex querying to the backend via the repository layer.

### 6.1.2.0.0 Sequence Name

#### 6.1.2.1.0 Sequence Name

Admin invites a new user

#### 6.1.2.2.0 Repository Role

Initiator

#### 6.1.2.3.0 Required Interfaces

- N/A (Direct Cloud Function call)

#### 6.1.2.4.0 Method Specifications

- {'method_name': 'ref.read(userManagementNotifierProvider.notifier).inviteUser(email, role)', 'interaction_context': "When the Admin submits the 'Invite User' form (US-004).", 'parameter_analysis': "Takes the 'email' (String) and 'role' (String) from the form.", 'return_type_analysis': "Returns 'Future<void>'. The notifier handles success or failure, updating the UI state accordingly.", 'analysis_reasoning': "The application logic calls a 'httpsCallable' function to the backend. This sequence ensures the secure, server-side-only execution of user invitations."}

#### 6.1.2.5.0 Analysis Reasoning

This demonstrates the pattern for secure, privileged operations. The client collects input and triggers a trusted backend function, but does not perform the core logic itself.

## 6.2.0.0.0 Communication Protocols

### 6.2.1.0.0 Protocol Type

#### 6.2.1.1.0 Protocol Type

Riverpod State Management

#### 6.2.1.2.0 Implementation Requirements

Define a graph of providers for application state, dependencies, and business logic. UI widgets will exclusively use 'ref.watch' and 'ref.read' to interact with this graph.

#### 6.2.1.3.0 Analysis Reasoning

This is the primary internal communication protocol, enabling a reactive, unidirectional data flow that is scalable and testable, aligning with Flutter best practices.

### 6.2.2.0.0 Protocol Type

#### 6.2.2.1.0 Protocol Type

HTTPS (via Firebase SDK)

#### 6.2.2.2.0 Implementation Requirements

Use 'FirebaseFunctions.instance.httpsCallable()' for all interactions with backend Cloud Functions. Implement robust error handling to catch and interpret specific error codes from the backend.

#### 6.2.2.3.0 Analysis Reasoning

This is the secure communication protocol for client-to-server commands that fall outside standard Firestore operations, ensuring authenticated and authorized execution.

# 7.0.0.0.0 Critical Analysis Findings

## 7.1.0.0.0 Finding Category

### 7.1.1.0.0 Finding Category

Performance Bottleneck

### 7.1.2.0.0 Finding Description

The reporting module, with its complex, multi-field filtering requirements (REQ-1-057, US-060), poses a significant performance and cost risk if Firestore queries are not properly optimized with composite indexes.

### 7.1.3.0.0 Implementation Impact

The data access layer ('REPO-LIB-CLIENT-008') must implement server-side filtering, and the 'app-web-admin' UI must implement pagination/infinite scrolling for all report tables. Fetching entire datasets to the client for filtering is not viable.

### 7.1.4.0.0 Priority Level

High

### 7.1.5.0.0 Analysis Reasoning

Failure to address this will result in a slow, expensive, and unscalable reporting feature, which is a core part of the Admin's value proposition.

## 7.2.0.0.0 Finding Category

### 7.2.1.0.0 Finding Category

Architectural Compliance

### 7.2.2.0.0 Finding Description

Adherence to Clean Architecture (REQ-1-072) requires strict discipline. There is a risk of developers placing business logic inside widgets or making direct service calls from the UI, bypassing the Riverpod application layer.

### 7.2.3.0.0 Implementation Impact

A clear directory structure and PR review process must be established to enforce the separation of concerns. All data flow must be channeled through Riverpod providers.

### 7.2.4.0.0 Priority Level

High

### 7.2.5.0.0 Analysis Reasoning

Deviating from the mandated architecture will degrade maintainability and testability, accumulating technical debt that will be costly to refactor later.

## 7.3.0.0.0 Finding Category

### 7.3.1.0.0 Finding Category

Security

### 7.3.2.0.0 Finding Description

Many administrative actions (e.g., user deactivation US-008, team deletion US-013, tenant deletion US-022) are destructive or have cascading effects. They must be handled transactionally and securely on the backend.

### 7.3.3.0.0 Implementation Impact

These actions cannot be implemented as simple client-side Firestore writes. Each requires a dedicated, secure Firebase Cloud Function that validates the caller's permissions and performs all database modifications in an atomic transaction.

### 7.3.4.0.0 Priority Level

High

### 7.3.5.0.0 Analysis Reasoning

Client-side implementation would be insecure and prone to data inconsistency. A backend-driven approach is mandatory for data integrity and security.

# 8.0.0.0.0 Analysis Traceability

## 8.1.0.0.0 Cached Context Utilization

Analysis synthesized information from all provided context items. The repository description and architecture map provided the primary scope. The requirements list and user stories were mapped to specific UI modules. The architecture patterns defined the internal structure. The database design informed the data interaction patterns, and sequence diagrams clarified the communication with backend services.

## 8.2.0.0.0 Analysis Decision Trail

- Decision: Classify the repository as a Presentation/Application layer component based on its description and dependencies.
- Decision: Group functional requirements into modules (User Mgmt, Settings, Reports) to structure the implementation plan.
- Decision: Identify reporting as the highest risk/complexity feature due to data query needs.
- Decision: Mandate that all complex/secure admin actions must be delegated to Cloud Functions based on sequence diagrams and security best practices.

## 8.3.0.0.0 Assumption Validations

- Assumption: 'REPO-LIB-CLIENT-008' will provide all necessary repository interfaces and their concrete implementations for Firestore. This app will not contain any direct Firebase SDK calls for data manipulation.
- Assumption: The Firebase backend will expose a set of callable Cloud Functions with a well-defined API contract for secure administrative actions.

## 8.4.0.0.0 Cross Reference Checks

- Verified that the technology stack in the repository description (Flutter for Web, Riverpod) aligns with the architectural requirements (Clean Architecture, REQ-1-072).
- Cross-referenced functional requirements (e.g., REQ-1-057 Reporting) with user stories (e.g., US-059 to US-064) to build a complete picture of the feature set.
- Validated that the need for Cloud Functions (inferred from security/transactional needs) is supported by the sequence diagrams showing calls to the 'Application Services' layer.
