"TEST-SEC-001","Firestore Security","Security","Integration","Critical","true","High","Verify that a user from Tenant A cannot read any data from the `/tenants/tenant_B/users` collection, enforcing strict multi-tenant data isolation.","Critical - A failure represents a catastrophic data breach and loss of all customer trust.","Medium","Firebase Emulator Suite is running. Two tenants (A and B) and one user for each tenant are created. Test user is authenticated as the user from Tenant A.","1. Authenticate as User A with custom claim `tenantId: 'tenant_A'`. 2. Attempt a Firestore `get` operation on the path `/tenants/tenant_B/users/user_B`. 3. Assert that the operation is denied and throws a 'permission-denied' error.","The Firestore read operation must fail with a 'permission-denied' error, confirming the security rule is correctly enforced.","Two distinct tenant IDs; Two user Auth objects with corresponding custom claims.","Firebase Emulator Suite; Jest; TypeScript","2","6","1","TASK-BE-076 (Implement firestore.rules)","CI Environment with Firebase Emulator Suite","Test case passes 100% of the time.

"TEST-FUNC-002","Data Lifecycle","Functional","Integration","Critical","true","High","Verify that the `purgeExpiredTenants` scheduled function correctly identifies and logs an expired tenant in 'dry-run' mode without performing any destructive actions.","Critical - A bug could lead to irreversible, catastrophic loss of customer data.","High","Firebase Emulator Suite is running. One tenant is created with `status: 'pending_deletion'` and a `deletionTimestamp` in the past. One active tenant exists.","1. Seed the emulator Firestore with the test tenants. 2. Manually trigger the `purgeExpiredTenants` function with `dryRun: true`. 3. Inspect the function logs. 4. Query the emulator Firestore.","The function logs must contain a message indicating it would delete the expired tenant. The Firestore database state must remain completely unchanged for both tenants.","Tenant documents with 'active' and expired 'pending_deletion' statuses.","Firebase Emulator Suite; Jest; TypeScript","3","12","4","TASK-BE-026 (Implement Scheduled Function for Permanent Tenant Deletion)","CI Environment with Firebase Emulator Suite","Function completes successfully.

"TEST-UNIT-003","User Management","Functional","Unit","High","true","High","Verify the hierarchy traversal logic within the `updateUserSupervisor` function correctly detects a multi-level, indirect circular dependency (e.g., A->B->C, then C->A).","High - Failure to detect loops breaks approval workflows and can cause infinite loops in the system.","High","Unit test setup for a TypeScript function.","1. Mock the Firestore data access layer. 2. Create an in-memory user hierarchy: User C reports to B, User B reports to A. 3. Call the validation logic with an attempt to set User A's supervisor to User C. 4.

"TEST-INT-004","External Integrations","Integration","System","High","true","Medium","Verify the `exportToGoogleSheets` scheduled function correctly handles a revoked OAuth token, updates the integration status to 'error' in Firestore, and does not lose data.","High - Failure of a key paid feature and potential for silent data export failures.","High","Staging environment is running. A test tenant is configured for Google Sheets export. Several 'approved' attendance records exist that have not been exported.","1. In the test Google Account, manually revoke the application's permissions. 2. Manually trigger the `exportToGoogleSheets` function for the test tenant. 3. Query Firestore for the tenant's integration status document. 4. Verify the status is 'error' and `errorType` is 'permission_revoked'. 5. Restore permissions and re-trigger the function. 6. Verify the previously failed records are now successfully exported to the Google Sheet.","The system must gracefully handle the auth failure, update its state accordingly, and successfully process the queued data on the next successful run.","A dedicated Google test account; A test tenant with active Google Sheets configuration; Un-exported 'approved' attendance records.","GCP Console; Postman (or gcloud CLI to trigger function); Google Sheets","4","16","8","TASK-BE-051 (Implement Scheduled Function for Google Sheets Export)","Staging environment with live GCP services.","Error state is correctly recorded.
