"Resource Rebalancing","Developer 'be.dev2' is over-allocated at 113%, while 'be.dev3' is under-allocated at 33%.","Reassign a high-complexity task like TASK-BE-076 (Security Rules) from be.dev2 to be.dev1 (Senior). Reassign a medium-complexity task like TASK-BE-045 (Escalation) from be.dev2 to be.dev3.","Balanced workload across team, reduced risk on critical security task, and improved project predictability.","1","Immediate (Sprint Planning)","All developers utilized between 75-90% of their capacity.","Reduced risk of burnout and delays, improving on-time delivery probability by an estimated 15%."
"Cross-training","Critical skill gaps exist, with single points of failure for Security Architecture (be.dev1) and CI/CD (be.dev3).","Mandate pair programming between be.dev1 and be.dev2 on TASK-BE-075/076. Dedicate 10% of be.dev2's buffer capacity to shadow be.dev3 on CI/CD maintenance.","Creates redundancy for critical skills, reducing key person dependency risk by 50%.","32","8 weeks (duration of project)","At least two developers can confidently design security rules and troubleshoot the CI/CD pipeline.","Mitigates RISK-006, avoiding potential project delays valued at over $40,000."
