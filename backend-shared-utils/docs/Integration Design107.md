## 1.2 Relevant Requirements

### 1.2.1 Requirement Id

#### 1.2.1.1 Requirement Id

REQ-1-076

#### 1.2.1.2 Requirement Text

The system must implement comprehensive monitoring and logging. All server-side logging and monitoring shall be handled by Google Cloud's Operations Suite.

#### 1.2.1.3 Validation Criteria

- Inspect the logs for Cloud Functions in the Google Cloud console.
- Verify that an alert policy for function error rates is active in Cloud Monitoring.

#### 1.2.1.4 Implementation Implications

- The library must provide a standardized logger utility that outputs structured JSON payloads compatible with Google Cloud Logging.
- The logger's output for errors must be structured in a way that enables the creation of log-based metrics for alerting on error rates.
- A centralized error handling utility is required to ensure all exceptions are reported through the standardized logger.

#### 1.2.1.5 Extraction Reasoning

This is the primary driver for the library's existence. The `StructuredLogger` and `ErrorHandler` components are the direct implementation of this requirement, providing a reusable foundation for all other backend services to meet their logging obligations.

### 1.2.2.0 Requirement Id

#### 1.2.2.1 Requirement Id

REQ-1-065

#### 1.2.2.2 Requirement Text

The system must not store any secrets (e.g., API keys for SendGrid or Google Maps) directly in source code or environment variables. All such secrets shall be stored in Google Secret Manager. Cloud Functions must be granted the appropriate IAM permissions to access these secrets from Secret Manager at runtime.

#### 1.2.2.3 Validation Criteria

- Code review confirms that no API keys or other secrets are present in the Cloud Functions codebase.
- Verify that secrets are stored in Google Secret Manager for the project.
- Verify that the Cloud Function's service account has the 'Secret Manager Secret Accessor' IAM role.

#### 1.2.2.4 Implementation Implications

- The library must provide a secure and performant client for accessing Google Secret Manager.
- This client must cache secrets in memory to avoid excessive API calls and latency, which is critical for meeting performance NFRs (REQ-1-067).
- This component centralizes the logic for secret retrieval, ensuring it is done securely and consistently across all services.

#### 1.2.2.5 Extraction Reasoning

This security requirement mandates a specific pattern for handling secrets. The `SecretManagerClient` component within this library is the designated, reusable implementation of this pattern for all backend services.

### 1.2.3.0 Requirement Id

#### 1.2.3.1 Requirement Id

REQ-1-025

#### 1.2.3.2 Requirement Text

The primary mechanism for enforcing multi-tenant data segregation shall be Firestore Security Rules. Upon authentication, each user's ID token must contain a tenantId custom claim. All database security rules must use this claim to ensure that read and write operations are restricted to documents associated with the user's own tenant.

#### 1.2.3.3 Validation Criteria

- Verify that the user authentication process correctly sets a tenantId custom claim on the user's token.
- Write a test case where a user from Tenant A attempts to read data from Tenant B and verify the operation is denied by security rules.

#### 1.2.3.4 Implementation Implications

- While security rules are the primary enforcement, Cloud Functions using the Admin SDK bypass these rules. Therefore, every function must manually validate the caller's context.
- This library must provide a utility to reliably parse the `tenantId`, `userId`, and `role` from a Cloud Function's request context.
- This utility provides the foundation for all backend services to correctly enforce multi-tenancy and RBAC in their own logic.

#### 1.2.3.5 Extraction Reasoning

This requirement, along with REQ-1-068 (RBAC), necessitates a standardized way for all Cloud Functions to interpret the security context of a request. The `FirebaseContextUtils` component in this library provides this critical, shared functionality.

## 1.3.0.0 Relevant Components

### 1.3.1.0 Component Name

#### 1.3.1.1 Component Name

StructuredLogger

#### 1.3.1.2 Component Specification

Provides a facade over the Google Cloud Logging SDK to produce structured JSON logs. It automatically injects request context (tenantId, userId) and service metadata into every log entry. It exposes methods for different log levels (info, warn, error) that map to the correct severity in Google Cloud.

#### 1.3.1.3 Implementation Requirements

- Must be instantiated with a service name to identify the log source (e.g., 'identity-service').
- Error logs must be structured with a dedicated 'error' field containing the message, name, and stack trace to facilitate log-based alerting as per REQ-1-076.
- Must include logic to sanitize log payloads, redacting sensitive keys like 'password' or 'token' to prevent secret leakage.

#### 1.3.1.4 Architectural Context

A core utility in the Cross-Cutting Layer, providing the implementation for consistent, observable logging across all backend services.

#### 1.3.1.5 Extraction Reasoning

Directly implements REQ-1-076 by providing the standardized tooling for server-side logging within Google Cloud's Operations Suite.

### 1.3.2.0 Component Name

#### 1.3.2.1 Component Name

ErrorHandler

#### 1.3.2.2 Component Specification

Provides a higher-order function that wraps a Cloud Function handler. This wrapper provides a standardized `try...catch` block, uses the `StructuredLogger` to report any exceptions, and returns a consistently formatted JSON error response to the client.

#### 1.3.2.3 Implementation Requirements

- Must be able to distinguish between custom application errors (which may have specific HTTP status codes) and unexpected system errors (which should default to 500).
- Integrates with `FirebaseContextUtils` to include request context in all error logs for better debugging.

#### 1.3.2.4 Architectural Context

A key utility in the Cross-Cutting Layer, promoting consistency and reducing boilerplate code for exception handling in all backend services.

#### 1.3.2.5 Extraction Reasoning

A necessary component to fulfill REQ-1-076, as it ensures all errors from all functions are captured and logged in a uniform manner, enabling effective monitoring and alerting.

### 1.3.3.0 Component Name

#### 1.3.3.1 Component Name

FirebaseContextUtils

#### 1.3.3.2 Component Specification

A set of pure utility functions to safely parse and validate the authentication context from a Firebase Function request (e.g., `CallableContext`). It extracts the `tenantId`, `userId`, and `role` from the JWT custom claims.

#### 1.3.3.3 Implementation Requirements

- Must throw a specific, catchable `AuthenticationError` if required claims are missing from an authenticated request.
- Must return a strongly-typed `AuthenticatedContext` object to provide type safety to consuming services.

#### 1.3.3.4 Architectural Context

A fundamental security utility in the Cross-Cutting Layer that enables all backend services to enforce multi-tenancy and RBAC policies consistently.

#### 1.3.3.5 Extraction Reasoning

Directly supports the server-side enforcement of multi-tenancy and RBAC as defined in requirements like REQ-1-025 and REQ-1-068. It is a classic shared utility to prevent code duplication and standardize a security-critical operation.

### 1.3.4.0 Component Name

#### 1.3.4.1 Component Name

SecretManagerClient

#### 1.3.4.2 Component Specification

Provides a simple, memoized (cached) wrapper around the Google Secret Manager client library. It exposes a single method to securely fetch the latest version of a secret by name.

#### 1.3.4.3 Implementation Requirements

- The client MUST implement in-memory caching for fetched secrets for the lifetime of a function instance to reduce latency and API call costs, as per performance requirements.
- Must be implemented as a singleton to avoid creating multiple clients and exhausting resources.
- Must handle IAM permission errors gracefully and provide clear log messages for easier debugging.

#### 1.3.4.4 Architectural Context

A security utility in the Cross-Cutting Layer that provides the concrete implementation for secure credential management, enabling compliance with REQ-1-065.

#### 1.3.4.5 Extraction Reasoning

Explicitly required to fulfill REQ-1-065, ensuring that all services access secrets in a standardized, secure, and performant way.
