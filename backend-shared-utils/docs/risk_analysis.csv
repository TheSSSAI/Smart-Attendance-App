"RISK-001","Technical","A flaw in the `firestore.rules` file fails to properly enforce multi-tenant data isolation, allowing a user from Tenant A to read or write data belonging to Tenant B. This represents a catastrophic security breach and loss of all customer trust.","3","5","15","High","All data access operations across the entire backend, especially WI-020 (Implement Firestore Security Rules).","Complexity of the security ruleset combined with human error, leading to an overly permissive rule or a missed edge case in the `request.auth.token.tenantId` validation.","Implement a comprehensive, mandatory automated test suite for `firestore.rules` using the Firebase Emulator Suite. All pull requests modifying security rules must be peer-reviewed by at least two senior engineers. Adopt a 'deny-by-default' rule structure.","In case of a detected breach, an emergency deployment of a highly restrictive 'lockdown' ruleset will be executed to block all client access. An incident response plan will be activated to audit logs, identify the scope of the breach, and communicate with affected customers.","This risk is difficult to monitor directly. Post-deployment, run a set of automated 'canary' tests that attempt cross-tenant access from a dedicated test tenant to validate production rules.","Backend Lead","2025-02-15","Not Started"
"RISK-002","Operational","A bug in the scheduled `purgeExpiredTenants` Cloud Function (WI-009) incorrectly identifies active tenants for deletion, resulting in the irreversible, catastrophic loss of customer data. This is a business-ending event.","2","5","10","Medium","WI-009 (Implement Scheduled Function for Permanent Tenant Deletion), REQ-1-035.","A logical error in the function's query for identifying expired tenants, potentially related to timezone miscalculations or incorrect status checks.","The function must run in a 'dry-run' mode by default, logging tenants it would delete without executing the deletion. A manual review and explicit approval step are required to run the function in 'execute' mode. The function must re-verify the tenant status within a transaction immediately before deletion.","The only recourse is a disaster recovery scenario: restore the entire Firestore database from the last successful daily backup (as per REQ-1-071). This implies a potential data loss of up to 24 hours.","Configure a Cloud Monitoring alert that fires if the number of tenants identified for deletion in a single run exceeds a predefined threshold (e.g., 5% of total tenants), indicating a potential anomaly.","DevOps Lead","2025-03-01","Not Started"
"RISK-003","Technical","Inefficient Firestore queries, particularly for reporting and notification fan-out (WI-012), lack necessary composite indexes. This leads to failed queries, poor application performance (<500ms p95 violated), and excessive document reads, causing high operational costs.","4","4","16","High","All reporting features, WI-012 (onEventCreate Notification), WI-016 (Approval Escalation), WI-021 (Define Firestore Indexes).","Failure to analyze all query patterns during development and define the required indexes in `firestore.indexes.json`. Overlooking the performance impact of querying large collections.","Mandate query performance analysis as part of the code review process for any new feature. All composite indexes must be defined as code in `firestore.indexes.json`. Implement server-side data pre-aggregation for complex reporting dashboards to reduce real-time query load.","If a feature is causing performance degradation in production, temporarily disable it via a feature flag. An emergency hotfix deployment will be prepared with the required index or an optimized query.","Monitor Firestore read operations count in the GCP console. Set up GCP Budget alerts to detect unexpected cost increases. Monitor Cloud Function execution times for functions performing queries.","Backend Lead","2025-02-28","Not Started"
"RISK-004","External","The Google Sheets API integration (WI-018) fails persistently due to a breaking change in the API, changes in OAuth 2.0 token handling, or API rate limits being exceeded. This disables a key feature for paying customers.","3","4","12","Medium","WI-017 (Google OAuth Flow), WI-018 (Google Sheets Export Function), REQ-1-008.","Over-reliance on a third-party service whose API and policies are outside of project control. Insufficiently robust error handling for all possible API error codes.","Implement comprehensive error handling and alerting for the export function, as specified in REQ-1-060. Subscribe to Google API developer blogs for deprecation notices. Encapsulate the API client in a dedicated service to simplify future updates.","Provide a manual, in-app CSV export feature for all reports as a reliable fallback. If the API fails, the system should queue failed records and automatically retry exporting them once the integration is restored.","Set up a Cloud Monitoring alert for a high error rate (>1%) on the `exportToGoogleSheets` Cloud Function.","Backend Integration Specialist","2025-03-10","Not Started"
"RISK-005","Quality","The automated test suite, particularly for security rules and destructive functions, becomes flaky or provides incomplete coverage. This leads to a false sense of security and allows critical bugs to be deployed to production.","3","5","15","High","WI-020 (Security Rules), WI-009 (Tenant Purge), WI-024 (CI/CD Pipeline).","Insufficient time allocated for test maintenance. Tests are not designed to handle the asynchronous nature of the Firebase Emulator Suite, leading to intermittent failures.","Treat test code as production code, subject to the same code review and quality standards. Invest in a dedicated testing framework for Firestore rules. The CI/CD pipeline must enforce the 80% coverage minimum and fail the build if it drops.","If the automated suite is deemed unreliable, temporarily halt automated deployments and institute a mandatory, comprehensive manual QA checklist before any production release until test reliability is restored.","Monitor the CI/CD pipeline for a high rate of test failures on the main branch. A failure rate above 10% on pushes should trigger an immediate investigation into test flakiness.","QA Lead","2025-02-20","Not Started"
"RISK-006","Resource","The project is dependent on a small number of engineers with specialized knowledge in both Firebase architecture and TypeScript. The departure of a key person could significantly delay the project and introduce quality issues.","2","4","8","Medium","All high-complexity work items, especially WI-009, WI-018, WI-020.","Concentration of critical, non-trivial knowledge in one or two team members without adequate documentation or knowledge sharing.","Implement a mandatory pair programming policy for all critical-risk features (e.g., tenant deletion, security rules). Enforce comprehensive documentation for all backend services and architectural decisions. Conduct regular internal knowledge-sharing sessions.","Maintain a shortlist of pre-vetted freelance Firebase/GCP specialists who can be brought in on short notice to backfill knowledge gaps. Allocate an emergency budget for external consultation.","Track the number of pull requests for critical components that are only reviewed or understood by a single person. This indicates a knowledge silo.","Engineering Manager","2025-02-10","In Progress"
