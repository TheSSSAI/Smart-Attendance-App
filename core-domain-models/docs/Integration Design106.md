## 1.2 Relevant Requirements

- {'requirement_id': 'REQ-1-073', 'requirement_text': "The system's data model in Firestore shall be structured with a root `/tenants/{tenantId}` collection for tenant-specific data. Key sub-collections and their purpose are: `/users` for user profiles; `/teams` for team structures; `/attendance` for individual check-in/out records; `/events` for calendar events; `/auditLog` for immutable records of critical actions; `/config` for tenant-wide settings; and `/linkedSheets` for Google Sheets integration metadata. All queries must be optimized by defining necessary composite indexes in `firestore.indexes.json`.", 'validation_criteria': ['Inspect the Firestore database schema and verify it matches the specified collection structure.', 'Verify that data for a specific tenant is nested appropriately or contains a `tenantId` field for rule-based security.', 'Verify that the `firestore.indexes.json` file is populated with indexes required for application queries.'], 'implementation_implications': ['This repository must define TypeScript interfaces and Zod validation schemas for each key entity: User, Team, AttendanceRecord, Event, AuditLog, TenantConfiguration, and LinkedSheet.', 'These models will serve as the single source of truth for data contracts across all backend services.', 'The models must include fields like `tenantId` to support the multi-tenant architecture described in other requirements.'], 'extraction_reasoning': "This requirement is the primary and most comprehensive directive for the core-domain-models repository. The repository's entire purpose is to provide a code-level implementation of the data model specified in this requirement, acting as the canonical data contract for the entire backend system."}

## 1.3 Relevant Components

## 1.4 Architectural Layers

- {'layer_name': 'Domain Model Layer (Entities)', 'layer_responsibilities': 'This layer is responsible for defining the core data structures (entities) of the application, such as User, Team, and AttendanceRecord. It contains no business logic or external dependencies, serving as the foundational data contract for the entire system.', 'layer_constraints': ['Must not contain any application or business logic.', 'Must not contain any database access or persistence logic.', 'Must have zero dependencies on any other application layers (e.g., services, persistence).', 'Must be highly reusable and publishable as a shared package (e.g., NPM).'], 'implementation_patterns': ["Clean Architecture: This library represents the innermost 'Entities' layer, which is a core tenet of the Clean Architecture pattern specified in the project architecture (REQ-1-072)."], 'extraction_reasoning': "The core-domain-models repository is explicitly described as a logic-free, foundational library for data entities. This perfectly embodies the 'Entities' layer of the Clean Architecture pattern by centralizing data contracts and having no outgoing dependencies on other application layers, making it the foundational block on which other services are built."}

## 1.5 Dependency Interfaces

*No items available*

## 1.6 Exposed Interfaces

- {'interface_name': 'Data Model Interfaces & Schemas', 'consumer_repositories': ['identity-access-services', 'attendance-workflow-services', 'team-event-management-services', 'reporting-export-services'], 'method_contracts': [], 'service_level_requirements': [], 'implementation_constraints': ['This repository will be published as a private, versioned NPM package to be consumed by other backend repositories.', 'Versioning of this package must be strictly managed using semantic versioning to prevent breaking changes in dependent services.'], 'extraction_reasoning': 'The primary purpose of this repository is to expose a consistent set of data contracts (TypeScript interfaces and Zod validation schemas) for all core entities. All other backend services depend on these contracts to ensure data consistency and integrity across the distributed system. The contract is provided at compile-time, not runtime.'}

## 1.7 Technology Context

### 1.7.1 Framework Requirements

The library must be written in TypeScript. It must use the Zod library for creating data validation schemas.

### 1.7.2 Integration Technologies

- TypeScript: For defining data type interfaces.
- Zod: For creating and exporting runtime data validation schemas.

### 1.7.3 Performance Constraints

Not applicable. This is a logic-free library of type definitions and validators with no runtime I/O.

### 1.7.4 Security Requirements

Validation schemas must be comprehensive and strict to act as the first line of defense against malformed or malicious data entering any service that consumes this library.
