"RISK-001","Technical","Introduction of breaking changes (e.g., renaming a field, changing a type) in the schemas could cause build failures and runtime errors in all consuming downstream microservices, leading to system-wide instability.","3","5","15","High","All development tasks in dependent repositories (e.g., 'identity-access-services', 'attendance-workflow-services') that consume this NPM package.","The repository serves as a foundational data contract library. Unmanaged evolution of these contracts without a strict versioning and communication protocol will inevitably break dependent services.","Implement and enforce a strict Semantic Versioning (SemVer) policy. Use automated tools like 'semantic-release' in the CI/CD pipeline. All pull requests must be reviewed by a senior developer to classify changes as Major (breaking), Minor (feature), or Patch (fix).","If a breaking change is accidentally released in a minor/patch version, immediately publish a new patch version that reverts the change. Communicate the incident to all development teams and assist with rollbacks.","A Pull Request modifying any existing schema property (name or type) without a 'BREAKING CHANGE:' commit message footer.","Tech Lead / DevOps Lead","2024-08-15","Not Started"
"RISK-002","Quality","A developer adds business logic, framework dependencies (e.g., Firestore SDK), or any external service call to this library, violating its core architectural principle of being a pure, dependency-free 'Entities' layer.","2","5","10","Medium","All tasks in this repository. This risk corrupts the repository's purpose and undermines the system's Clean Architecture.","Developer misunderstanding of Clean Architecture principles or expediency leading to a violation of separation of concerns. This risk is explicitly called out in the critical analysis findings.","Add a CI pipeline step that fails if forbidden packages are detected in 'package.json' dependencies. Mandate rigorous code reviews with a specific checklist item: 'Verify no business logic or external dependencies have been added.' Clearly document this constraint in the repository's README.md.","If a violation is merged, create a P1 (highest priority) tech debt ticket to immediately refactor the offending logic out of the library into the appropriate service layer. Block further releases of the library until the refactor is complete.","A pull request adds a new dependency to 'package.json' other than a utility library, or a code review identifies a function with side effects.","Tech Lead","2024-08-15","Not Started"
"RISK-003","Technical","A Zod schema is implemented incorrectly and does not accurately reflect the data model specified in requirements (e.g., REQ-1-073) or the database ERD, leading to data validation errors or data integrity issues in production.","3","3","9","Medium","All schema implementation tasks (e.g., WI-001 through WI-010).","Human error during translation of requirements into code, or misinterpretation of a specific field's validation rules (e.g., optional vs. required, data type).","Enforce comprehensive unit testing for every schema, covering all fields, types, and edge cases. Mandate that all pull requests include a link to the specific requirement(s) being implemented for easier cross-referencing by the reviewer.","If an incorrect schema is deployed, a new patch version of the library with the corrected schema must be published immediately. A data migration script may be required in the consuming service to fix any incorrect data that was persisted.","A bug is reported in a consuming service related to 'ZodError' or unexpected data shapes that should have been caught by validation.","Lead Developer","2024-08-20","Not Started"
"RISK-004","Quality","Unit tests for the Zod schemas are inadequate or miss critical edge cases (e.g., boundary values, null vs. undefined, incorrect enum values), allowing a flawed schema to be published and leading to runtime data integrity failures.","2","4","8","Medium","All testing tasks (e.g., WI-017 through WI-021).","Developer rushing or lack of diligence in writing thorough tests. The project plan explicitly calls for testing, so this is a risk of incomplete execution.","Configure the CI/CD pipeline to enforce a high test coverage threshold (e.g., 95% line coverage) using Jest's coverage reporting. The build will fail if coverage drops below this threshold. Code review process must include a specific check for test quality and edge case coverage.","If a validation bug is found in production, the first step is to write a failing unit test that reproduces the bug. Then, fix the schema to make the test pass and publish a new version of the library.","Code coverage report in the CI/CD pipeline shows a drop below the 95% threshold for any file.","QA Lead / Lead Developer","2024-08-20","Not Started"
"RISK-005","Operational","The NPM package publication process fails due to misconfigured credentials, network issues with the registry, or version conflicts, blocking the release of new data contracts and halting development in all dependent microservices.","2","4","8","Medium","Deployment and release of the entire library.","Manual deployment errors, expired authentication tokens for the NPM registry, or network instability.","Fully automate the package publication process within the CI/CD pipeline (e.g., GitHub Actions). Use secure, token-based authentication to the NPM registry. Implement a dry-run step in the pipeline to verify the package before publishing.","Document a manual publication process as a fallback. Ensure at least two individuals have the necessary permissions and knowledge to perform a manual publish in an emergency.","A CI/CD pipeline run for a release branch fails at the 'npm publish' step.","DevOps Lead","2024-08-15","Not Started"
