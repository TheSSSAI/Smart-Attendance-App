"RISK-R001","Resource Dependency","The entire project relies on a single developer, creating a critical single point of failure. Any unexpected absence will completely halt progress.","Medium","High","[""All""]","100","Mandate rigorous, frequent code reviews with the Tech Lead to ensure knowledge transfer. Enforce comprehensive documentation for all design decisions and schema implementations.","The Tech Lead will take over development in case of the primary developer's absence, with an expected 2-day ramp-up period and 20% productivity loss.","Primary developer is unresponsive or on unplanned leave for more than 1 day.","5000","2 days to implement contingency."
"RISK-R002","Quality","Developer inadvertently adds business logic or framework-specific dependencies (e.g., Firestore SDK), violating the library's architectural purity (RISK-002 from context).","Low","High","[""All""]","5","Implement a CI pipeline check that fails if forbidden packages are detected in dependencies. Code review checklist must explicitly verify the absence of business logic.","If merged, create a high-priority tech debt ticket to immediately refactor the logic out of the library. Block subsequent releases until fixed.","A pull request adds a new dependency to package.json, triggering an alert for the Tech Lead.","2000","3 days to refactor and release patch."
"RISK-R003","Technical","The complexity of the AttendanceRecord schema (T008.1) is underestimated, leading to implementation delays and inadequate test coverage for edge cases (RISK-003, RISK-004 from context).","Medium","Medium","[""T008.1"",""T008.2""]","3","Allocate a dedicated timebox for peer-designing and reviewing the schema before implementation. Prioritize T008.1 and T008.2 at the beginning of Sprint 3 to allow for buffer time.","Descope less critical fields or simplify validation for the initial release, creating tech debt tickets to address them later. Use the ample capacity buffer to absorb overruns.","Task T008.1 exceeds its estimated hours by more than 25%.","1000","2 days to re-plan or descope."
