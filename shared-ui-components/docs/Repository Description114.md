# 3 Description

A reusable Flutter library containing the application's design system and common UI widgets. Extracted from the 'attendance-app-client', this repository includes foundational UI elements like themed buttons, text input fields, loading indicators, standardized layouts, and custom card widgets that are used consistently across both the mobile app and the web admin dashboard. The goal is to ensure a consistent look and feel, reduce UI code duplication, and accelerate feature development. It implements the application's branding, color palette, and typography, adhering to Material 3 design principles. This component is a pure UI library with no business logic or data access dependencies.

## 20.3 Decomposition Reasoning

To create a centralized, reusable design system (component library). This ensures visual consistency between the mobile and web apps, reduces duplicated UI code, and allows a dedicated team or individual to focus on building and maintaining high-quality, generic UI components.

## 20.4 Extracted Responsibilities

- Application theme (colors, typography).
- Common widgets (buttons, inputs, cards, dialogs).
- Standardized page layouts and scaffolds.

## 20.5 Reusability Scope

- Used by both the mobile and web admin applications.
- Could be used in future applications from the same company.

## 20.6 Development Benefits

- Faster UI development.
- Enforces a consistent user experience.
- Simplifies app-wide visual theme changes.
