Wrap the component in a test harness. 2. Use `tester.ensureVisualUpdate()`. 3. Find the component's RenderBox and assert its size is at least 48x48. 4. Find the Semantics widget and verify its label. 5. Set `tester.binding.window.textScaleFactor` to 2.0 and verify no overflow errors occur.","All interactive components have a minimum size of 48x48.
