"Knowledge Transfer","High concentration of critical skills (CI/CD, Accessibility, Performance) in one Senior Developer.","Schedule mandatory paired programming sessions for CI/CD setup (4 hours) and accessibility audits (2 hours per complex component).","Reduces key person dependency risk by 30%. Increases mid-level developer's capability, improving future velocity.","12","4 weeks","Mid-level developer can independently resolve a minor CI pipeline issue. Mid-level developer can conduct a basic accessibility audit.","Avoids potential project stall worth >$20,000 if senior dev becomes unavailable."
"Process Enforcement","Risk of inconsistent styling and quality due to developer oversight.","Implement custom lint rules in `analysis_options.yaml` to ban hardcoded `Color` and `TextStyle` constructors and enforce `const` usage.","Automates enforcement of design system standards, reducing code review time by 10% and preventing significant technical debt.","4","2 days","CI pipeline automatically fails pull requests with hardcoded styles.","Saves an estimated 40 hours of future refactoring work."
