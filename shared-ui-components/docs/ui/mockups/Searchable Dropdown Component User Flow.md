# 3.0 Diagram Elements

## 3.1 Actors Systems

- User
- Client Application (UI Component)
- Backend API

## 3.2 Key Processes

- Initial data fetch upon focus
- Asynchronous search/filtering based on user input
- State update upon selection or clearing
- Error handling and recovery

## 3.3 Decision Points

- API Response for initial data fetch (Success/Error)
- API Response for filtered search (Success/Error)

## 3.4 Success Paths

- User focuses, sees options, and makes a selection.
- User focuses, types a search query, and selects from the filtered results.

## 3.5 Error Scenarios

- The initial fetch of options fails, showing an error state.
- A subsequent search query fails, showing a temporary error.
- User attempts to retry a failed fetch.

## 3.6 Edge Cases Covered

- User clearing a selected value to return to the idle state.
- User re-focusing a field that already has a selected value.

Embed this diagram directly in the component's storybook documentation or technical specification for easy reference.

# 7.0 Validation Checklist

- ✅ All critical user paths documented (focus, search, select, clear)
- ✅ Error scenarios and recovery paths included (fetch fail, search fail, retry)
- ✅ Decision points clearly marked with conditions (API Response?)
- ✅ Mermaid syntax validated and renders correctly
- ✅ Diagram serves intended audience needs (developers, QA)
