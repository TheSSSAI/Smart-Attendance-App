# 1 Diagram Info

## 1.1 Diagram Name

Primary Button State Diagram

## 1.2 Diagram Type

stateDiagram-v2

## 1.3 Purpose

To visually document the lifecycle and state transitions of the Primary Button component, guiding developers and QA on its behavior based on user interactions and system events.

## 1.4 Target Audience

- developers
- designers
- QA engineers

## 1.5 Complexity Level

low

## 1.6 Estimated Review Time

2-3 minutes

# 3.0 Diagram Elements

## 3.1 Actors Systems

- User
- System/UI

## 3.2 Key Processes

- User Interaction (Mouse/Keyboard)
- System State Change

## 3.3 Decision Points

- Mouse Enter/Leave
- Keyboard Tab In/Out
- Mouse Down/Up
- Key Press/Release
- Action Trigger/Completion
- System Enable/Disable

## 3.4 Success Paths

- Idle -> Hovered -> Pressed -> Loading -> Idle
- Idle -> Focused -> Pressed -> Loading -> Idle

## 3.5 Error Scenarios

- Not applicable for a state diagram; states themselves are neutral. The 'Action Complete' transition can result from either a success or error state in the application logic.

## 3.6 Edge Cases Covered

- Disabled state transition from multiple possible prior states
- Loading state for asynchronous operations

## 6.3 Maintenance Notes

Update this diagram if new states (e.g., a 'success' state with a checkmark) are added to the button component's lifecycle.

## 6.4 Integration Recommendations

Embed in the design system documentation for the Button component and link in relevant user stories or technical tasks involving button implementation.
