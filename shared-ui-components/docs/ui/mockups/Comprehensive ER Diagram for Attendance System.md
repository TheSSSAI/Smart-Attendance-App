# 1 Diagram Info

## 1.1 Diagram Name

Comprehensive ER Diagram for Attendance System

## 1.2 Diagram Type

erDiagram

## 1.3 Purpose

To visualize the complete relational data model for the attendance tracking system, showing all entities, their primary attributes, and the relationships between them. This serves as a blueprint for database schema design and development.

## 1.4 Target Audience

- developers
- database administrators
- architects
- QA engineers

## 1.5 Complexity Level

high

## 1.6 Estimated Review Time

5-10 minutes

# 3.0 Diagram Elements

## 3.1 Actors Systems

- Tenant
- User
- Team
- AttendanceRecord
- Event
- AuditLog
- SubscriptionPlan
- TenantConfiguration
- GoogleSheetIntegration
- DailyUserSummary

- Event assignment (polymorphic via join table)

## 3.3 Decision Points

- Not applicable for ER Diagrams

## 3.4 Success Paths

- Not applicable for ER Diagrams

## 3.5 Error Scenarios

- Not applicable for ER Diagrams

## 3.6 Edge Cases Covered

- Polymorphic event assignments (to users or teams)
- Recursive supervisor-subordinate hierarchy

## 6.3 Maintenance Notes

Must be updated whenever the database schema changes (e.g., adding new tables, columns, or relationships) to remain the source of truth.

## 6.4 Integration Recommendations

Embed in the project's primary technical documentation (e.g., Confluence, Notion, or repository README) as the source of truth for the data model.
