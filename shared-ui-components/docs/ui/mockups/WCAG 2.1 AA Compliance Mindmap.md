# 3.0 Diagram Elements

## 3.1 Actors Systems

- User (with disability)
- Frontend Application
- Screen Reader
- Operating System

## 3.2 Key Processes

- Ensuring color contrast
- Implementing keyboard navigation
- Providing screen reader labels
- Making touch targets large enough

## 3.3 Decision Points

- Does this text meet contrast ratio?
- Is this element focusable?
- Does this icon have a label?

## 3.4 Success Paths

- A user with a screen reader can successfully navigate and use the entire application.

## 3.5 Error Scenarios

- Text is unreadable due to low contrast
- A button cannot be activated via keyboard
- A screen reader announces a generic 'button' with no context.

## 3.6 Edge Cases Covered

- Dynamic content changes (e.g., error messages) are announced to screen readers.
- Layouts reflow correctly at maximum text scaling.
