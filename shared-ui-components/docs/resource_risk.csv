"RISK-R001","Skill Gap","Failure to meet mandatory WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility requirements due to lack of specialized team expertise and complexity of manual testing.","Medium","Critical","[""TASK-AC-001"",""TASK-AC-003"",""TASK-MC-002"",""TASK-OG-004""]","8","Create and enforce a mandatory accessibility checklist (TASK-QA-001). Mandate manual testing with TalkBack/VoiceOver for every UI-related pull request.","Allocate a dedicated 'Accessibility Hardening' sprint before release for a full audit and remediation, delaying the project.","A code review or manual test identifies a WCAG 2.1 AA violation.","20000","1-2 weeks for remediation sprint."
"RISK-R002","Key Person Dependency","The Senior Developer is a single point of failure for all infrastructure (CI/CD) and complex component (Calendar, Performance) tasks. Their unavailability would halt progress on the critical path.","Medium","High","[""TASK-INF-002"",""TASK-MC-002"",""TASK-OG-004""]","12","Implement paired programming sessions for CI/CD setup. Assign the Mid-level developer to write comprehensive tests for complex components to build familiarity.","Engage the Tech Lead to take over critical tasks, but this will pull them from other project responsibilities.","Senior Developer's assigned tasks show a slippage of more than 2 days.","","Ongoing."
"RISK-R003","External Dependency","The selected third-party calendar library (TASK-OG-003) proves to have unsolvable performance or accessibility issues late in the development cycle, forcing a replacement and significant rework.","Low","High","[""TASK-OG-004""]","10","Conduct a time-boxed technical spike (TASK-OG-003) early in Sprint 2 to evaluate candidate libraries against performance and accessibility criteria before full implementation.","Revert to building a simpler, custom calendar component with a reduced feature set, impacting the product roadmap.","Initial performance profiling of the integrated calendar shows significant jank or accessibility audit reveals major flaws.","10000","1 week for re-evaluation and integration."
