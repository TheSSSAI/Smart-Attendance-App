## 1.2 Relevant Requirements

### 1.2.1 Requirement Id

#### 1.2.1.1 Requirement Id

REQ-1-062

#### 1.2.1.2 Requirement Text

The user interface design must adhere to platform-specific guidelines to provide a native look and feel. For the Android application and the web dashboard, the UI must follow Google's Material Design 3 principles. For the iOS application, the UI must follow Apple's Human Interface Guidelines (HIG).

#### 1.2.1.3 Validation Criteria

- UI/UX review confirms the Android app uses Material 3 components and patterns.
- UI/UX review confirms the iOS app uses standard iOS components and navigation patterns.
- UI/UX review confirms the web dashboard uses Material 3 components.

#### 1.2.1.4 Implementation Implications

- The shared UI library must implement the design system tokens (colors, typography, spacing) as a Flutter ThemeData object, aligned with Material Design 3.
- Components should be built to be platform-adaptive where necessary, using Flutter's capabilities to render appropriately on iOS and Android.
- The library will serve as the single source of truth for all visual styling, ensuring consistency across consumer applications.

#### 1.2.1.5 Extraction Reasoning

This requirement is the primary directive for the entire existence of the shared-ui-components library. The library's core purpose is to codify and enforce the visual design system mandated by this requirement across all Flutter clients (mobile and web).

### 1.2.2.0 Requirement Id

#### 1.2.2.1 Requirement Id

REQ-1-063

#### 1.2.2.2 Requirement Text

The mobile application and web dashboard must be designed and developed to meet the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 at a Level AA conformance. This includes, but is not limited to, ensuring all functionality is accessible via screen readers (e.g., TalkBack, VoiceOver), maintaining a minimum color contrast ratio of 4.5:1 for text, and supporting dynamic text scaling based on user's system settings.

#### 1.2.2.3 Validation Criteria

- Perform an accessibility audit using automated tools and manual testing with screen readers.
- Verify that all interactive elements have proper labels for screen readers.
- Use a color contrast checker to validate that all text meets the 4.5:1 ratio.
- Increase the system font size and verify the app layout adapts without breaking or clipping text.

#### 1.2.2.4 Implementation Implications

- All widgets in this library must be built with accessibility as a primary concern.
- Interactive components (buttons, inputs) must have appropriate semantic properties for screen readers.
- Color definitions in the theme must be pre-validated against WCAG 2.1 AA contrast ratios.
- Component layouts must use responsive widgets (e.g., Flexible, Expanded) to gracefully handle dynamic text scaling without overflow errors.

#### 1.2.2.5 Extraction Reasoning

As the foundational UI library, this repository is the most effective place to enforce accessibility standards. Building accessible atomic components ensures that all higher-order components and screens composed from them inherit these critical accessibility features.

### 1.2.3.0 Requirement Id

#### 1.2.3.1 Requirement Id

REQ-1-064

#### 1.2.3.2 Requirement Text

The application's architecture must support internationalization (i18n) from the outset. All user-facing strings in the UI must not be hardcoded; instead, they must be stored in resource files (e.g., ARB files in Flutter). The initial product release will only provide an English (en-US) localization, but the framework must be in place to easily add other languages in the future.

#### 1.2.3.3 Validation Criteria

- Code review confirms that no user-facing strings are hardcoded in the application's source code.
- Verify that all UI text is sourced from a dedicated English language resource file.
- Demonstrate that changing a string in the resource file correctly updates the UI text upon rebuild.

#### 1.2.3.4 Implementation Implications

- All widgets within this library must be designed to be stateless regarding text content.
- Any widget that displays text (e.g., PrimaryButton, AlertBanner) must accept the text as a constructor parameter, typically as a `String` or another `Widget`.
- This ensures the consuming applications (`app-mobile`, `app-web-admin`) are responsible for providing localized strings, keeping the UI library pure.

#### 1.2.3.5 Extraction Reasoning

This requirement imposes a critical architectural constraint on the design of every component in this library, enforcing a clean separation between presentation and content.

## 1.3.0.0 Relevant Components

### 1.3.1.0 Component Name

#### 1.3.1.1 Component Name

AppTheme

#### 1.3.1.2 Component Specification

A core utility class that defines and provides the application's ThemeData for both light and dark modes. It is the central implementation of the application's design system, codifying colors, typography, and component styles based on Material Design 3.

#### 1.3.1.3 Implementation Requirements

- Provide static `ThemeData` objects (e.g., `AppTheme.lightTheme`, `AppTheme.darkTheme`).
- Theme must use Material 3 (`useMaterial3: true`).
- All colors must be sourced from a centralized color palette class.
- All text styles must be sourced from a centralized typography class.
- Component-specific themes (e.g., `ElevatedButtonThemeData`, `InputDecorationTheme`) must be defined here to ensure global consistency.

#### 1.3.1.4 Architectural Context

The heart of the design system within the Presentation Layer. This component is consumed once at the root of consumer applications to style the entire widget tree.

### 1.3.4.0 Component Name

#### 1.3.4.1 Component Name

AttendanceListItem

#### 1.3.4.2 Component Specification

A molecular component that displays a summary of a single attendance record. It has variants for the Subordinate's view (date-prominent) and the Supervisor's view (name-prominent) and can display various status and exception badges.

#### 1.3.4.3 Implementation Requirements

- Must be a configurable widget that accepts an attendance data model object.
- Must conditionally display status badges (e.g., 'Pending', 'Approved') and exception flags (e.g., 'Offline', 'Clock Discrepancy').
- Must support a multi-select state with a checkbox for bulk operations in the Supervisor's queue.

#### 1.3.4.4 Architectural Context

Molecular component within the Presentation Layer, designed for use within list-based Organisms like the Approval Queue List.

#### 1.3.4.5 Extraction Reasoning

This is a key reusable component for multiple user stories (US-037, US-038). It's a prime example of composing atomic components into a more complex, reusable widget for this library to provide.
