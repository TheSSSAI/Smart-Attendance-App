# CHANGELOG

## 1.0.0

*   **Initial Release**:
    *   Established the foundational design system based on Material 3, including `AppTheme`, colors, typography, and spacing.
    *   Created a comprehensive library of atomic and molecular UI components, such as `PrimaryButton`, `TextInputField`, `StatusBadge`, and `AttendanceListItem`.
    *   Implemented organism-level components like `AuthenticationForm` and `CalendarView`.
    *   Ensured all components are theme-aware, state-agnostic, and localization-ready in compliance with REQ-1-062 and REQ-1-064.
    *   Integrated accessibility standards (WCAG 2.1 AA) across all components, fulfilling REQ-1-063, with semantic labels, sufficient touch targets, and support for dynamic text scaling.
    *   Set up a runnable example application to serve as a living style guide.
    *   Configured a CI pipeline for automated testing and analysis.
