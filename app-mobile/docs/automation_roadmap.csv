"Phase 1: Foundational Security & Backend","High","4","50","Jest, Firebase Emulator Suite","120","Very High - Mitigates critical security risks and enables parallel development.","4 hours/month","8","CI/CD pipeline with automated Jest execution and emulator startup scripts.","100% of Firestore security rules automated tests passing; >90% unit test coverage for all Cloud Functions.","Learning curve for advanced emulator usage.","Pair programming sessions, dedicated documentation.","Ensures the core platform is secure and reliable from the start."
"Phase 2: Core Mobile E2E Journeys","High","6","40","Flutter integration_test","160","High - Reduces manual regression testing time for the mobile app by 70%.","10 hours/month","16","Device farm integration (e.g., Firebase Test Lab) for running E2E tests on various devices.",">95% pass rate for the E2E suite; Critical paths (login, check-in, offline sync) fully automated.","Flakiness of UI tests; Managing test state across runs.","Implement robust test data setup/teardown; Use explicit waits and stable selectors.","Accelerates mobile release cycles with high confidence."
"Phase 3: Admin Web & Advanced Features","Medium","8","60","Flutter integration_test (for Web)","200","Medium - Automates complex setup for reporting and integration tests.","12 hours/month","8","Browser automation grid (e.g., Selenium Grid) for cross-browser testing.","Key reporting and integration E2E scenarios are automated; Cross-browser compatibility tests run nightly.","Complexity of automating OAuth flows and third-party integrations.","Use dedicated test accounts for external services; Store secrets securely.","Ensures reliability of key administrative and paid features."
