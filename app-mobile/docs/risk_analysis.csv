"RISK-001","Technical","A flaw in the Firestore Security Rules for multi-tenancy could lead to a catastrophic data breach, where users from one tenant can access, modify, or delete data belonging to another tenant.","3","5","15","High","All data operations across the entire application (WI-001-2-2). Affects the core architectural principle of tenant isolation.","The complexity of writing a comprehensive security ruleset and the potential for a single logical error to bypass tenant isolation checks based on JWT custom claims.","Implement a mandatory, exhaustive test suite for Firestore Security Rules using the Firebase Emulator Suite. All PRs modifying `firestore.rules` must include corresponding test cases and be reviewed by the Tech Lead.","In case of a detected breach, execute an emergency protocol to deploy a restrictive global rule (`allow read, write: if false;`), halting all database access. Immediately begin a data access audit and prepare customer notifications.","A security rule test fails in the CI/CD pipeline. A post-deployment automated test that attempts cross-tenant data access fails.","Tech Lead","2024-06-15","Not Started"
"RISK-002","Technical","The complex multi-region architecture required for data residency (REQ-1-024) is misconfigured, leading to tenant data being stored in the wrong geographic region, causing a major compliance breach (e.g., GDPR).","3","5","15","High","Tenant onboarding and all subsequent data storage (WI-001-2-3). Critical for enterprise and EU customers.","High architectural complexity of implementing a project-per-region or similar model on Firebase/GCP, coupled with the risk of human error during manual or scripted provisioning.","Conduct a mandatory technical spike/Proof-of-Concept to validate the chosen multi-region architecture. Implement provisioning using Infrastructure-as-Code (e.g., Terraform) to ensure repeatability and reduce manual error.","Develop and document a high-effort manual data migration plan to move an incorrectly provisioned tenant to the correct region. This would involve significant downtime for the affected tenant.","A post-provisioning script fails its check when verifying the actual GCP location of a new tenant's Firestore instance against the intended location.","Cloud Architect","2024-06-30","Not Started"
"RISK-003","External","The automated Google Sheets export feature fails due to breaking changes, rate limiting, or authentication issues with the Google Sheets API, leading to stale or incomplete external reports for customers.","4","3","12","Medium","Admin data export and reporting features (WI-004-2-1). Affects a key feature for paid subscription tiers.","Heavy dependency on a third-party API with a complex OAuth 2.0 authentication flow and its own operational constraints (quotas, availability).","Implement comprehensive error handling, logging, and alerting for the export Cloud Function (as per REQ-1-060). Design the function to be idempotent and to automatically retry exporting failed records on the next successful run.","Provide a manual CSV export feature from the Admin dashboard (US-064) as a reliable fallback for Admins if the automated sync fails persistently.","Google Cloud Monitoring alert fires when the `exportToSheets` function's error rate exceeds 1% over a 24-hour period.","Backend Lead","2024-07-15","Not Started"
"RISK-004","Quality","The application fails to meet WCAG 2.1 Level AA accessibility standards (REQ-1-063), resulting in a poor user experience for users with disabilities, potential legal challenges, and exclusion from certain enterprise or government contracts.","4","4","16","High","All UI-related development work across the entire application (WI-005-2-1).","Lack of specialized accessibility knowledge within the development team, and the difficulty of retrofitting accessibility onto complex custom widgets.","Integrate automated accessibility checks (e.g., color contrast, tap target size) into the CI pipeline. Mandate manual testing with TalkBack (Android) and VoiceOver (iOS) as part of the Definition of Done for all UI-related user stories.","Allocate a dedicated 'accessibility debt' sprint post-MVP to remediate issues found in a formal third-party accessibility audit.","An accessibility issue is flagged during a PR review. A user reports an accessibility-related bug during UAT.","Frontend Lead","2024-06-20","Not Started"
"RISK-005","Technical","The offline-first attendance marking feature (REQ-1-009) suffers from persistent sync failures or local data corruption, leading to loss of user attendance data and erosion of trust in the system's reliability.","3","4","12","Medium","Core attendance marking for mobile users (WI-003-1-3). This is a primary feature of the application.","Complexity of managing the Firestore offline cache, OS-specific background processing limitations, and handling various network failure scenarios robustly.","Implement the persistent in-app notification for sync failures (US-035) to proactively alert users. Create a comprehensive E2E test suite that simulates various offline scenarios, including prolonged disconnection and network interruptions during sync.","Provide clear user-facing documentation on how to manually verify synced data and a support channel for reporting data loss incidents for manual correction by an Admin.","Firebase Crashlytics logs an increase in errors related to local database writes or network requests from the sync manager.","Mobile Lead","2024-07-25","Not Started"
"RISK-006","Timeline","The development effort for complex, multi-faceted features like Data Residency (WI-001-2-3) and the transactional Attendance Correction Workflow (WI-004-1-2) is significantly underestimated, causing critical path delays and jeopardizing release dates.","4","4","16","High","EPIC-001 (Platform Architecture) and EPIC-004 (Advanced Features).","Overlooking the hidden infrastructure, security, and transactional complexities of enterprise-grade features that go beyond simple CRUD operations.","Decompose large epics into smaller, verifiable work items. Mandate technical spikes or Proof-of-Concepts for high-complexity features to de-risk them and get accurate estimates before committing to full development.","Maintain a prioritized backlog that allows for de-scoping of lower-priority advanced features (e.g., deferring some report types) to protect the core feature release timeline.","A work item's actual development time exceeds its estimate by more than 30%. A technical spike reveals unforeseen architectural blockers.","Project Manager","2024-06-10","Not Started"
"RISK-007","Operational","The Disaster Recovery (DR) plan for restoring the Firestore database (REQ-1-071) fails during a real incident due to being untested or poorly documented, resulting in permanent data loss and failure to meet the 4-hour RTO.","2","5","10","Medium","System reliability and business continuity (WI-005-1-2).","Treating the DR plan as a 'document-only' task without performing realistic, hands-on restoration drills.","Mandate and schedule quarterly DR drills in a non-production environment. Automate the restoration process as much as possible using scripts. Ensure the DR documentation is a step-by-step checklist, not a theoretical document.","If automated restoration fails, the plan must include a fallback to manual restoration steps and clear escalation paths to on-call GCP/Firebase experts.","A scheduled quarterly DR drill is missed. The DR drill takes longer than the 4-hour RTO to complete.","DevOps Lead","2024-08-01","Not Started"
"RISK-008","Resource","A key person dependency on a developer with specialized skills in advanced Firestore Security Rules or GCP multi-region architecture leaves the project vulnerable if that person becomes unavailable, causing significant delays and quality issues.","3","4","12","Medium","Multi-tenancy implementation (WI-001-2-2), Data Residency (WI-001-2-3), and Supervisor Approval Workflow (WI-003-2-2).","Concentration of critical, complex knowledge in a single team member without adequate cross-training or documentation.","Implement a mandatory pair programming policy for all work on critical components (Security Rules, IaC). Require thorough documentation and internal tech talks for complex architectural decisions. Ensure at least two team members review every critical PR.","Maintain a budget for engaging external, specialized consultants on short notice if a key team member is lost.","Only one developer on the team is consistently assigned to tasks in a specific high-complexity area.","Engineering Manager","2024-06-25","Not Started"
