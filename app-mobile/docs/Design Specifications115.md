# 2 Repository Analysis

## 2.1 Repository Definition

### 2.1.1 Scope Boundaries

- Primary responsibility is the presentation and feature-level state management for the cross-platform (iOS/Android) mobile application.
- Secondary responsibility is to serve as the integration hub for client-side libraries, device-native features (GPS, Push Notifications), and backend services (Firebase).
- Implements all user-facing features and workflows for the 'Subordinate' and 'Supervisor' roles, including attendance marking, history viewing, approval dashboards, and event calendars.
- Excludes the Admin Web Dashboard, server-side scheduled jobs, and the concrete implementation of the data access layer (which is consumed as a library).

### 2.1.2 Technology Stack

- Flutter 3.x (Dart) for the cross-platform UI framework.
- Riverpod 2.x for state management and dependency injection.
- Firebase SDK (Authentication, Firestore, Cloud Messaging) for backend communication.
- google_maps_flutter for map visualizations and 'geolocator' for GPS data capture.

### 2.1.3 Architectural Constraints

- Must adhere to the client-side implementation of the 'Clean Architecture' pattern, separating Presentation, Application (Use Cases), and Domain layers.
- All data access must be channeled through repository interfaces (e.g., IAttendanceRepository), abstracting the data source as per the 'Repository Pattern'.
- Must implement robust offline-first capabilities for all data submission actions, leveraging Firestore's local cache.
- The UI must be built to be reactive, listening to real-time data streams from Firestore via Riverpod providers.

# 4.0.0.0.0 Architecture Analysis

## 4.1.0.0.0 Architectural Patterns

### 4.1.1.0.0 Pattern Name

#### 4.1.1.1.0 Pattern Name

Clean Architecture

#### 4.1.1.2.0 Pattern Application

Mandated by REQ-1-072, this pattern will structure the repository into three distinct layers: Presentation (Flutter Widgets), Application (Use Cases/State Notifiers), and Domain (Entities/Repository Interfaces).

#### 4.1.1.3.0 Required Components

- SubordinateDashboardScreen (Presentation)
- CheckInUseCase (Application)
- IAttendanceRepository (Domain)

#### 4.1.1.4.0 Implementation Strategy

The Presentation layer will be built with Flutter widgets. The Application and Domain layers will be pure Dart. Riverpod will be used to provide dependencies (like Use Cases and Repositories) to the Presentation layer and manage UI state.

#### 4.1.1.5.0 Analysis Reasoning

This pattern is explicitly required to ensure testability, separation of concerns, and maintainability for the complex mobile client.

### 4.1.2.0.0 Pattern Name

#### 4.1.2.1.0 Pattern Name

Repository Pattern

#### 4.1.2.2.0 Pattern Application

The Application layer will interact with data through abstract interfaces (e.g., 'IAttendanceRepository'), decoupling it from the concrete data source implementation (Firestore). This is a core tenet of the specified Clean Architecture.

#### 4.1.2.3.0 Required Components

- CheckInUseCase
- IAttendanceRepository

#### 4.1.2.4.0 Implementation Strategy

Define abstract repository classes in the Domain layer. These interfaces will be implemented in a separate data library (REPO-LIB-CLIENT-008) and injected into the Application layer's use cases using Riverpod.

#### 4.1.2.5.0 Analysis Reasoning

This pattern is essential for testability and for abstracting data sources, which is critical for implementing offline support by allowing the repository to manage local and remote data.

## 4.2.0.0.0 Integration Points

- Can be assigned to multiple Teams (many-to-many via assignedTeamIds array).

#### 5.1.2.5.0 Access Patterns

- Query for events where current user's ID is in 'assignedUserIds' OR user's team ID is in 'assignedTeamIds'.
- Supervisors create new event documents.

#### 5.1.2.6.0 Analysis Reasoning

This entity is crucial for the calendar/scheduling feature. The mobile app needs to perform complex queries to fetch a user's schedule.

## 5.2.0.0.0 Data Access Requirements

### 5.2.1.0.0 Operation Type

#### 5.2.1.1.0 Operation Type

Real-time Streaming

#### 5.2.1.2.0 Required Methods

- watchPendingRecords(supervisorId): Streams a list of pending attendance records for a supervisor.
- watchUserEvents(userId, teamIds): Streams a list of events assigned to a user or their teams.

#### 5.2.1.3.0 Performance Constraints

UI must update within seconds of a backend data change. Queries must use indexes to avoid full collection scans.

#### 5.2.1.4.0 Analysis Reasoning

The Supervisor dashboard and event calendar require real-time data to be effective, necessitating the use of Firestore's snapshot listeners.

### 5.2.2.0.0 Operation Type

#### 5.2.2.1.0 Operation Type

Offline-First Writes

#### 5.2.2.2.0 Required Methods

# 6.0.0.0.0 Sequence Analysis

## 6.1.0.0.0 Interaction Patterns

### 6.1.1.0.0 Sequence Name

#### 6.1.1.1.0 Sequence Name

Offline Attendance Marking

#### 6.1.1.2.0 Repository Role

The repository acts as a facade, accepting the check-in/out data and writing it to the Firestore SDK's local cache without waiting for network.

#### 6.1.1.3.0 Required Interfaces

- IAttendanceRepository

#### 6.1.1.4.0 Method Specifications

- {'method_name': 'markAttendance', 'interaction_context': "Called from a Use Case when the user taps 'Check-In' or 'Check-Out'.", 'parameter_analysis': 'Accepts GPS data and a client timestamp. The method also determines if the action is a new check-in or an update for a check-out.', 'return_type_analysis': "Returns 'Future<void>'. The future completes upon successful write to the local cache, not the server.", 'analysis_reasoning': 'As per SEQ-268, this flow must provide immediate UI feedback based on local persistence, making the asynchronous but fast-completing Future essential.'}

#### 6.1.1.5.0 Analysis Reasoning

This sequence is critical for the app's offline reliability. The repository's role is to abstract the complexity of the Firestore SDK's offline behavior from the application logic.

### 6.1.2.0.0 Sequence Name

#### 6.1.2.1.0 Sequence Name

Supervisor Bulk Approval

#### 6.1.2.2.0 Repository Role

The repository exposes a method to perform a bulk update, which will be implemented by calling a secure backend Cloud Function.

#### 6.1.2.3.0 Required Interfaces

- IAttendanceRepository

#### 6.1.2.4.0 Method Specifications

- {'method_name': 'approveRecords', 'interaction_context': "Called from the Supervisor dashboard when multiple records are selected and 'Approve' is tapped.", 'parameter_analysis': "Accepts a 'List<String>' of 'attendanceRecordId's.", 'return_type_analysis': "Returns 'Future<void>' which completes after the backend function returns a success response.", 'analysis_reasoning': "As per US-041 and security best practices, a bulk write operation should be transactional and authorized on the server. The mobile client's repository will simply invoke this remote procedure via a callable function."}

#### 6.1.2.5.0 Analysis Reasoning

This interaction pattern ensures that complex, multi-document writes are handled atomically and securely on the backend, with the mobile app acting as the trigger.

## 6.2.0.0.0 Communication Protocols

- {'protocol_type': 'Firebase SDK (gRPC/HTTPS)', 'implementation_requirements': "The application must correctly initialize the Firebase app and use the singleton instances of services like 'FirebaseAuth.instance' and 'FirebaseFirestore.instance'. All communication details are abstracted by the SDK.", 'analysis_reasoning': 'This is the mandated communication protocol for all backend interactions as per the serverless architecture defined in REQ-1-013.'}

The combination of real-time data, offline capabilities, and role-based UIs creates a complex state management challenge. A well-structured Riverpod provider architecture is essential.

### 7.2.3.0.0 Implementation Impact

The team must establish clear patterns for using different provider types (e.g., 'StreamProvider' for real-time data, 'StateNotifierProvider' for form state, 'FutureProvider' for one-off async operations) to avoid an unmanageable and inefficient provider graph.

### 7.2.4.0.0 Priority Level

High

### 7.2.5.0.0 Analysis Reasoning

An ad-hoc approach to state management with Riverpod will lead to performance issues and significant technical debt.

# 8.0.0.0.0 Analysis Traceability

## 8.1.0.0.0 Cached Context Utilization

Analysis utilized all provided cached context, cross-referencing REQs (e.g., REQ-1-009, REQ-1-072), Architecture patterns (Clean Architecture), Database schema (Firestore ERD), Sequence diagrams (SEQ-268), and User Stories (US-033) to build a complete model of the repository's responsibilities and constraints.

## 8.2.0.0.0 Analysis Decision Trail

- Repository scope was defined by its description and cross-referenced with user stories (US-028 for Subordinate, US-037 for Supervisor) and requirements (REQ-1-001, REQ-1-013).
- Technology stack was confirmed via repository definition and REQ-1-075.
- Internal architecture was derived from REQ-1-072 (Clean Architecture) and the repository's 'architecture_map' which specified its dependency on a data library.
- Data interaction patterns were synthesized from database design (ID 54) and sequence diagrams (SEQ-267, SEQ-269).

## 8.3.0.0.0 Assumption Validations

- Validated the assumption that 'app-mobile' consumes a data layer from another repository by analyzing its 'architecture_map'.
- Validated the assumption that the app serves only 'Subordinate' and 'Supervisor' roles by analyzing requirements (e.g., REQ-1-010 for Admin web dashboard) and user stories.

## 8.4.0.0.0 Cross Reference Checks

- Cross-referenced REQ-1-009 (Offline Support) with SEQ-268 (Offline Sequence) and US-033 (Offline User Story) to ensure a consistent implementation strategy.
- Cross-referenced REQ-1-072 (Clean Architecture) with the Architecture document's patterns and the repository's dependency map to confirm the layered structure.
