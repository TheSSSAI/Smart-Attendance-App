"Cross-training","Critical skill dependency on the single backend developer creates a project bottleneck and a high-risk single point of failure (RISK-008).","Dedicate 10% of the frontend developer's capacity (6 hours/sprint) to pair program with the backend developer on non-critical backend tasks, such as simple Cloud Functions or data model implementation.","Reduces key person dependency risk by 30% over 3 sprints. Increases team velocity by allowing parallelization of simple backend/frontend tasks.","","6 weeks","Frontend developer can independently implement a simple callable Cloud Function by the end of Sprint 3.","Mitigates a high-impact risk, potentially saving weeks of delay, valued at over $30,000."
"Resource Allocation","The baseline plan has low resource utilization (avg 54%), indicating significant buffer but inefficient use of capacity.","Adopt the 'Augmented Team' scenario by hiring a mid-level backend contractor to accelerate the timeline and mitigate the key person dependency risk.","Reduces project duration by ~2 weeks and lowers the overall risk profile from High to Low.","9000","5 weeks","Project delivered on the accelerated 5-week timeline within the new budget.","Faster time-to-market and reduced risk of costly delays justify the additional resource cost."
