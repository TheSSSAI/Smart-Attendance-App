# 3 Description

This repository contains the main Flutter application targeted for iOS and Android mobile devices. It was the primary mobile-facing part of the original 'attendance-app-client'. This repository assembles the various shared client libraries (data access, UI) to build the complete user-facing application for Subordinate and Supervisor roles. It contains all the role-specific screens, feature-level state management (using Riverpod), navigation logic, and device-specific integrations like GPS and push notifications. It is responsible for delivering the core mobile experience: attendance marking, viewing event calendars, and the supervisor approval dashboard. Its focus is purely on presentation and user interaction for the mobile platform.

# 20.0.0 Decomposition Rationale

## 20.1.0 Operation Type

NEW_DECOMPOSED

## 20.2.0 Source Repository

REPO-CLIENT-001

## 20.3.0 Decomposition Reasoning

Separates the mobile application from the web admin dashboard. Mobile apps have a distinct release lifecycle (App Store reviews), different dependencies (GPS, notifications), and a different user focus (Subordinates/Supervisors). This separation allows for an optimized mobile CI/CD pipeline and a codebase focused solely on the mobile experience.

## 20.4.0 Extracted Responsibilities

- Subordinate user flows (check-in/out).
- Supervisor user flows (approvals).
- Mobile navigation and screen layouts.
- Device hardware integrations (GPS).

## 20.5.0 Reusability Scope

- N/A - This is a final, deployable application.

## 20.6.0 Development Benefits

- Focused development on the mobile user experience.
- Independent release schedule from the web app.
- Simplified dependency management for mobile-only packages.

# 25.0.0 Scope Boundaries

## 25.1.0 Must Implement

- All features for Subordinate and Supervisor roles on mobile.

## 25.2.0 Must Not Implement

- Admin dashboard features.
- Direct database queries (must use the data access layer).

## 25.3.0 Extension Points

- New mobile-specific features are added here.

## 25.4.0 Validation Rules

- Perform client-side input validation for a better UX, but do not rely on it for security.
