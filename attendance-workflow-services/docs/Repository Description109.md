# 3 Description

This microservice encapsulates the core business logic of the application: the 'Attendance Management' bounded context. It was decomposed from the 'attendance-app-backend' to isolate all functionality related to the attendance lifecycle. This includes the server-side logic for processing check-in and check-out events, flagging clock discrepancies, handling the supervisor approval workflow, managing the auditable attendance correction process, and executing the daily auto-checkout scheduled job. By containing this critical and complex domain logic in a single, focused service, it simplifies maintenance and allows the core feature of the product to evolve independently of other concerns like user management or reporting.

# 20.0.0 Decomposition Rationale

## 20.1.0 Operation Type

NEW_DECOMPOSED

## 20.2.0 Source Repository

REPO-BACKEND-002

## 20.3.0 Decomposition Reasoning

Isolates the most critical and complex business domainâ€”the attendance lifecycle. This allows the core value proposition of the product to be developed, tested, and deployed independently, increasing agility and reducing the risk of regressions in other areas.

## 20.4.0 Extracted Responsibilities

- Attendance record validation (e.g., clock discrepancy).
- Supervisor approval/rejection logic.
- Attendance correction workflow.
- Scheduled auto-checkout jobs.
- Approval escalation logic.

## 20.5.0 Reusability Scope

- This is a domain-specific service for this application.

## 20.6.0 Development Benefits

- Allows developers to focus on the core business logic without distraction.
- Simplifies testing of complex workflows.
- Independent deployment cycle for core features.
