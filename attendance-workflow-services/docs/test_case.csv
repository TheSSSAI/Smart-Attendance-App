"TEST-SEC-001","Multi-Tenancy","Security","Integration","Critical","true","High","Verify that a user from Tenant A cannot read or write data belonging to Tenant B, enforced by Firestore Security Rules using the `tenantId` custom claim.","Critical - A failure represents a complete data breach between customers.","Medium","Two tenants (A and B) exist. A user from Tenant A is authenticated. The Firestore Emulator is running with security rules loaded.","1. Authenticate as User A from Tenant A. 2. Using the client SDK, attempt to read a document from Tenant B's `/users` collection. 3. Verify the operation fails. 4. Attempt to write a new document to Tenant B's `/attendance` collection. 5. Verify the operation fails.","Both the read and write operations must be rejected by Firestore with a 'permission-denied' error.","Two distinct sets of user credentials and tenant data.","Firebase Emulator Suite, Jest (or similar test runner).","2","6","1","Firestore Security Rules (REQ-1-025, REQ-1-068).","Development environment with Firebase Emulator.","100% of cross-tenant access attempts must fail with 'permission-denied'.","Critical data breach, loss of customer trust, potential legal liability.","Every commit that modifies `firestore.rules`.","Medium","Emulator data is cleared after each test run.","This is a primary security validation test.","N/A","N/A"

Enable Airplane Mode on the device. 2. Tap the 'Check-In' button. 3. Verify UI updates to 'Checked In' and shows a 'pending sync' indicator. 4. Force-quit the application. 5. Disable Airplane Mode. 6. Relaunch the application. 7. Verify the sync occurs and the 'pending sync' indicator is removed. 8. Check the Firestore database to confirm the record exists with the `isOfflineEntry: true` flag.","The offline check-in is successfully captured, persists after an app restart, and automatically syncs to the server upon reconnection.","A test Subordinate user account.","Flutter `integration_test` framework, Physical Android/iOS devices.","6","24","8","Firestore Offline Persistence, Mobile UI (US-033).","Staging Firebase Project, Physical Devices.","100% of offline records are successfully synced within 60 seconds of reconnection.","Data loss, user frustration, loss of trust in system reliability.","Every release candidate build.","Low","Delete test attendance records after verification.","Synced data must still be validated by server-side security rules.","UI must remain responsive during offline actions.","Any 'pending sync' indicators must have accessible labels."

A test Admin is authenticated.","1. Invoke the `updateUser` Cloud Function (or the equivalent API). 2. Set the `userId` to Manager A's ID. 3. Set the new `supervisorId` to User C's ID. 4. Verify the function execution.","The Cloud Function must reject the operation and return a specific error code, e.g., 'circular_dependency_detected'.
