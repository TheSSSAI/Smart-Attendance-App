"RISK-001","Technical","A flaw in the Firestore Security Rules for multi-tenancy (e.g., a typo in `request.auth.token.tenantId` check) could allow a user from one tenant to access or modify data belonging to another, leading to a critical data breach.","3","5","15","High","All data operations (CRUD) across the entire application, especially WI-009 and WI-010 which define the core security model.","Human error in writing or maintaining the complex security ruleset that forms the primary barrier for data segregation between tenants.","Mandate 100% test coverage for all security rules related to tenancy and RBAC using the Firebase Emulator Suite. All changes to `firestore.rules` must be peer-reviewed by at least two engineers. Run automated cross-tenant access tests in the CI/CD pipeline.","In case of a breach, immediately deploy a global 'deny all' rule set to halt all data access. Trigger incident response protocol: analyze logs to determine breach scope, notify affected customers, and patch the faulty rule.","A security rule test fails in the CI pipeline. Anomaly detection in Firestore access logs (if configured). A customer reports seeing unexpected data.","Lead Backend Engineer","2024-06-30","Not Started"
"RISK-002","Quality","The dynamic reporting features (US-059, US-061) and list views rely on complex Firestore queries. Failure to define and deploy the correct composite indexes in `firestore.indexes.json` will lead to query failures at runtime, making key features unusable.","4","4","16","High","WI-058 (Dynamic Reporting Query), WI-060 (Summary Report), WI-061 (Punctuality Report), WI-062 (Exception Report), WI-063 (Audit Log Report).","Lack of developer discipline in managing Infrastructure as Code (IaC) for database indexes, or underestimation of Firestore's strict indexing requirements for compound queries.","Enforce a strict policy that any pull request introducing a new Firestore query must also include the corresponding index definition in `firestore.indexes.json`. Use the Firebase Emulator Suite during development to automatically generate and test index requirements.","If a feature fails in production due to a missing index, perform an emergency deployment of the required index via the Firebase CLI. Temporarily disable the failing feature in the UI via a feature flag if the fix is not immediate.","CI/CD E2E tests fail with a Firestore 'NEEDS_INDEX' error. Production monitoring reports a spike in failed database queries. Users report that a report page is failing to load.","Lead Backend Engineer","2024-06-15","Not Started"
"RISK-003","External","The Google Sheets integration (EPIC-008) requires storing a long-lived OAuth refresh token. If this token is leaked due to improper server-side storage (e.g., in Firestore instead of Secret Manager) or exposure to the client, an attacker could gain persistent access to the Admin's Google Drive and Sheets.","3","5","15","High","WI-064 (OAuth Flow), WI-066 (Scheduled Export Function), and the entire Google Sheets Integration epic (EPIC-008).","Developer error in handling sensitive credentials, bypassing the documented security pattern of using Google Secret Manager and keeping tokens server-side only.","Strictly enforce the use of Google Secret Manager for all OAuth tokens (REQ-1-069). Mandate a security-focused code review by a senior engineer for all code related to authentication and token handling. Implement automated secret scanning in the CI pipeline to prevent accidental commits.","If a leak is suspected, immediately revoke the compromised token from the server-side, delete the secret from Secret Manager, and guide the user on how to revoke the application's access from their Google Account security settings. Notify the user of the breach.","Secret scanner detects a token in the codebase. Anomaly detected in Google API usage logs for the user's account.","Lead Security Engineer","2024-08-30","Not Started"
"RISK-004","Operational","A bug in the highly destructive, scheduled tenant deletion function (`WI-030`) could lead to the accidental and irreversible deletion of data from the wrong tenant or multiple tenants, causing catastrophic data loss.","2","5","10","Medium","WI-030 (Tenant Deletion Workflow), specifically the scheduled function `processTenantDeletions`.","A logic error in the function's query to identify expired tenants (e.g., a missing or incorrect `where` clause) could cause it to target the wrong documents for deletion.","The function must run in a 'dry-run' mode by default, only logging what it would delete. An explicit flag must be set to enable actual deletion. The function must use a Firestore transaction to re-verify the tenant's deletion status before deleting. Configure a Cloud Monitoring alert if the function attempts to delete data for more than a threshold number of tenants in one run.","Immediately disable the scheduled Cloud Function. Initiate the documented disaster recovery plan to restore the affected tenant's data from the last daily backup (as per REQ-1-071).","The deletion count alert fires. A customer reports that their active tenant's data has vanished.","Lead Backend Engineer","2024-09-15","Not Started"
"RISK-005","Quality","The project mandate for WCAG 2.1 Level AA compliance (REQ-1-063) is not met due to inconsistent application of accessibility principles during development, leading to legal risk and excluding users with disabilities.","4","3","12","Medium","All UI-related work items, including WI-016, WI-022, WI-033, WI-040, WI-046, and all of EPIC-007.","Lack of developer training in accessibility, coupled with inadequate testing procedures that prioritize functional requirements over non-functional accessibility requirements under timeline pressure.","Integrate automated accessibility checks (e.g., Flutter's `SemanticsDebugger`) into the development workflow. Mandate manual testing with screen readers (VoiceOver, TalkBack) as part of the Definition of Done for all UI stories. Conduct a third-party accessibility audit before the first major release.","If major accessibility gaps are found late in the project, create a dedicated 'accessibility debt' backlog, prioritize fixes based on severity (e.g., login/check-in flows first), and communicate a remediation roadmap to stakeholders.","A key user flow is found to be unusable with a screen reader during a QA cycle. An automated accessibility scanner reports a high number of critical violations.","QA Lead","2024-07-31","Not Started"
"RISK-006","Resource","SMS Pumping fraud against the Phone OTP login feature (US-018) leads to unexpectedly high operational costs, potentially exceeding the project's budget for Firebase services.","3","4","12","Medium","WI-024 (Implement Phone OTP Login Flow), impacting the project budget and feature availability.","Failure to properly secure the public-facing phone authentication endpoint, allowing automated scripts to trigger a massive volume of costly SMS messages.","Enable and enforce Firebase's built-in abuse protection (App Check for Android/iOS). Implement strict server-side rate limiting on OTP requests per phone number and IP address. Configure GCP budget alerts specifically for Firebase Authentication costs to provide early warning.","If an attack is detected, immediately disable the Phone Number sign-in provider in the Firebase console to halt the costs. Investigate logs to identify the source and report the fraudulent activity to Google Cloud support to dispute charges.","GCP budget alert for Firebase Authentication costs is triggered. A sudden, anomalous spike in 'Phone Verification' requests is observed in the Firebase Console usage dashboard.","Lead Backend Engineer","2024-07-15","Not Started"
