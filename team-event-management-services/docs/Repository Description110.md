# 3 Description

This microservice is responsible for the 'Team and Schedule Management' bounded context. Extracted from the 'attendance-app-backend', it manages the creation and lifecycle of Teams and calendar-based Events. Its functions include creating, updating, and deleting teams, managing team memberships, assigning supervisors, and the full feature set for event management: creating single or recurring events, assigning events to individuals or teams, and triggering push notifications (via FCM) to users when they are assigned to a new event. This separation allows scheduling and organizational structure features to be managed and deployed independently from the core attendance workflow.

# 20.0.0 Decomposition Rationale

## 20.1.0 Operation Type

NEW_DECOMPOSED

## 20.2.0 Source Repository

REPO-BACKEND-002

## 20.3.0 Decomposition Reasoning

Separated based on the 'Team & Schedule Management' domain. This logic is distinct from the daily attendance workflow and often has a different rate of change. Isolating it allows for independent feature development around scheduling and organization without impacting core attendance functionality.

## 20.4.0 Extracted Responsibilities

- CRUD operations for Teams.
- Team membership management.
- Event creation, including recurrence.
- Assigning events to users/teams.
- Triggering event-related push notifications.

## 20.5.0 Reusability Scope

- Domain-specific to this application.

## 20.6.0 Development Benefits

- Clear ownership for scheduling and team structure features.
- Allows for future expansion of scheduling features (e.g., leave management) without touching other services.

# 25.0.0.0 Scope Boundaries

## 25.1.0.0 Must Implement

- All logic for managing teams and calendar events.

## 25.2.0.0 Must Not Implement

- Attendance approval workflows.
- User account creation.

## 25.3.0.0 Extension Points

- Can be extended with more complex scheduling rules or event types.

## 25.4.0.0 Validation Rules

- Prevent circular reporting structures when assigning supervisors.
