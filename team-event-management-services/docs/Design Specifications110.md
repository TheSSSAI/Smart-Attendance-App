- {'finding_category': 'Scalability Risk', 'finding_description': "The requirement to fetch all events for a user, including those assigned via team, poses a scalability risk. The Firestore 'array-contains-any' query, needed to check against all of a user's teams, is limited to 10 items in the 'in' array. A user assigned to more than 10 teams will cause this query to fail.", 'implementation_impact': "The data model for event assignment needs to be reconsidered. A denormalized approach, such as an '/events/{eventId}/assignees/{userId_or_teamId}' subcollection, would be more scalable. This allows for a more efficient collection group query to find all events for a user.", 'priority_level': 'High', 'analysis_reasoning': "This finding, identified from 'US-057' technical risks, indicates a fundamental limitation in the current data model that will break functionality for users in complex organizational structures. It must be addressed before implementation."}

# 8.0.0.0.0.0 Analysis Traceability
