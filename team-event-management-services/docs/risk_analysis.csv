"RISK-001","Technical","A flaw in the Firestore Security Rules or custom claims logic could lead to catastrophic data leakage between tenants, violating the core multi-tenant isolation requirement (REQ-1-002). This represents a critical business and compliance failure.","3","5","15","High","WI-002-1-1: Develop Comprehensive Firestore Security Ruleset, All data access operations across the entire application.","The entire security model is centralized on the correctness of the `firestore.rules` file and the server-side logic that sets JWT custom claims. Human error during development or maintenance is the most likely cause.","Implement a multi-layered testing strategy for security rules, including unit tests with the Firebase Emulator, automated integration tests for all critical data access patterns, and mandatory peer review by a security-focused developer for every change to `firestore.rules`.","Develop an emergency 'lockdown' security rule set that can be deployed instantly to block all non-admin data access. Maintain an incident response plan to identify, assess, and notify affected tenants using audit logs.","CI/CD pipeline will fail if security rule test coverage drops below 95%. Configure a scheduled job in a test environment to continuously run a suite of cross-tenant data access attempts and alert on any success.","Lead Backend Engineer","2025-02-28","Not Started"
"RISK-002","External","The automated Google Sheets export feature (WI-007-2-2) is highly complex and depends on the stability of Google's OAuth 2.0 and Sheets APIs. A breaking change, undocumented error, or service outage could lead to silent data export failures, corrupting external reports.","4","4","16","High","WI-007-2-2: Implement Google Sheets Export Workflow, US-067: Admin is alerted to a Google Sheets sync failure, US-068: Admin re-authorizes Google Sheets sync.","Tight coupling with a complex, external third-party service whose behavior is outside of project control. The OAuth 2.0 flow with refresh token management is notoriously fragile.","Implement robust, granular error handling in the export Cloud Function to differentiate between transient errors (retriable), auth failures (requires user action), and permanent errors. Use a persistent queue to track records that failed to export and ensure they are included in the next successful run (as per REQ-1-060).","The system will alert the Admin of the failure (US-067). If automation fails completely, the Admin can use the standard CSV export feature (US-064) as a manual fallback.","Configure a Google Cloud Monitoring alert to fire if the `exportToSheets` Cloud Function error rate exceeds 1% over a 24-hour period. Log every failed export attempt with detailed error codes.","Integration Specialist","2025-03-15","Not Started"
"RISK-003","Technical","A bug in a destructive, automated backend function, such as the scheduled tenant data deletion (WI-001-2-4) or user data anonymization (US-086), could lead to irreversible, catastrophic data loss for one or more tenants.","3","5","15","High","WI-001-2-4: Implement Tenant Deletion Backend Functions, US-086: User's personal data is anonymized after deactivation and retention period.","High complexity of batch processing logic combined with the irreversible nature of the delete operations. Insufficient testing of edge cases (e.g., race conditions, malformed data).","Mandate the implementation of a 'dry run' mode for all destructive functions, which logs the data that *would* be deleted without performing the action. Require >90% unit test coverage. All such functions must be deployed to staging and manually verified against test data before production deployment.","The primary contingency is the automated daily Firestore backup (REQ-1-067). The Disaster Recovery Plan must be immediately executed to restore the affected tenant's data from the last valid backup, accepting a data loss of up to 24 hours (RPO).","Configure high-severity alerts for any runtime error logged from these specific Cloud Functions. Any successful run of the deletion function should also generate a summary report for the operations team.","Lead Backend Engineer","2025-03-31","Not Started"
"RISK-004","Operational","Unoptimized Firestore queries in the reporting module (WI-007-1-1) or backend functions could lead to excessive read operations, causing severe performance degradation for large tenants and significant, unexpected cost overruns on GCP.","4","4","16","High","WI-007-1-1: Implement Comprehensive Reporting Module UI, All scheduled and event-triggered Cloud Functions that query data.","The requirement to support complex, multi-field filtering on large datasets. A failure to correctly define and deploy composite indexes in `firestore.indexes.json` will lead to inefficient (and costly) collection scans or outright query failure.","Mandate the use of server-side data aggregation via Cloud Functions for all summary reports. All new queries must be analyzed using the Firestore Profiler in a staging environment with a large, representative dataset before being merged to production. All indexes must be managed as code.","Implement feature flags to allow for the immediate disabling of expensive reports if costs spike. Develop a script to identify and alert on slow-running or high-cost queries by analyzing Firestore logs.","Set up GCP budget alerts to notify administrators when spending approaches 50%, 75%, and 90% of the monthly budget (REQ-1-076). Monitor Firestore 'Read Operations' and 'Query Execution Time' dashboards daily post-launch.","Database Architect","2025-03-01","Not Started"
"RISK-005","Technical","The offline attendance feature (WI-004-1-3) relies on Firestore's offline cache. A failure in the automatic sync process could lead to silent data loss if not detected. The requirement for a 24-hour failure notification (WI-004-1-4) indicates this is a known complexity.","4","4","16","High","WI-004-1-3: Implement Offline Attendance Caching, WI-004-1-4: Implement Persistent Sync Failure Notification.","Complexity of reliably tracking the age of pending writes within Firestore's opaque offline queue. The sync mechanism is also subject to unpredictable network conditions and OS-level restrictions on background tasks.","Implement an auxiliary local database (e.g., Drift/SQLite) to explicitly store metadata (ID, creation time) for every offline write. This creates a reliable source of truth for the 24-hour stale check, independent of the Firestore cache internals. This aligns with the implementation considerations for US-035.","The primary contingency is the user-facing notification and manual retry button (US-036). Additionally, the client should log any persistent sync failure event to a remote logging service (Crashlytics) for proactive monitoring by the support team.","Create a custom event in Crashlytics or Google Analytics for 'PersistentSyncFailure'. Set up an alert if the daily count of this event exceeds a predefined threshold (e.g., 0.1% of active users).","Lead Mobile Engineer","2025-04-15","Not Started"
"RISK-006","Quality","Failure to meet the stringent WCAG 2.1 Level AA accessibility standard (REQ-1-059) across the entire application. This is noted as a high-complexity, cross-cutting concern (WI-008-1-1) that is difficult to retrofit.","4","4","16","High","WI-008-1-1: Implement Accessibility Standards, All UI-related work items.","Lack of developer expertise in accessibility best practices. Insufficient time allocated for manual testing with screen readers (TalkBack/VoiceOver). Custom UI components are created without considering accessibility from the start.","Integrate automated accessibility checks (e.g., Axe for web, Flutter's built-in tools) into the CI/CD pipeline. Create a mandatory 'Accessibility Checklist' that must be completed for every new UI feature. Allocate dedicated sprint time for manual testing with screen readers on physical devices.","Engage a third-party accessibility auditing firm to review the application before major releases. Create a public-facing Accessibility Conformance Report (ACR) to document known issues and the roadmap for fixing them.","Any new UI-related pull request must include a section in its description detailing how accessibility was tested. Automated accessibility scanners in CI must not report any new critical or serious violations.","UX/UI Lead","2025-02-15","Not Started"
"RISK-007","Resource","The project requires a broad range of specialized skills (Flutter for Web, advanced Firestore, GCP infra, CI/CD). A skill gap in any of these areas or the loss of a key developer could lead to significant delays and reduced quality.","3","3","9","Medium","All high-complexity work items, particularly WI-001-2-2, WI-002-1-1, and WI-007-2-2.","Over-reliance on a small number of senior engineers with specific domain knowledge. Insufficient cross-training and documentation.","Implement a mandatory pair programming policy for all high-complexity and critical-risk tasks. Enforce a strict documentation standard for all backend functions and infrastructure setup. Create a skills matrix for the team and identify areas for targeted training or external consultation.","Maintain a shortlist of pre-vetted freelance specialists or a partner agency that can be engaged on short notice to fill critical skill gaps. Allocate a budget for emergency external consultation.","The team's skills matrix is reviewed quarterly. Any single point of failure (a skill held by only one person) is flagged for immediate action (cross-training or documentation).","Engineering Manager","2025-02-01","Not Started"
"RISK-008","Timeline","The project contains several features identified with 'High' complexity (e.g., Tenant Registration, Deletion, Sheets Export, Data Residency). Underestimation of the effort for these tasks could lead to a cascading delay across the entire project plan.","4","4","16","High","EPIC-001: Core Platform & Tenant Management, EPIC-007: Reporting & Integrations","Optimism bias in estimation. Failure to account for the complexity of security, error handling, and testing for these critical path features.","For each 'High' complexity Epic, conduct a technical spike to produce a detailed design document and a more granular task breakdown before committing to the full implementation sprint. Apply a 1.5x buffer to the initial time estimates for these specific epics.","Identify 'nice-to-have' features or lower-priority user stories that can be moved to a post-MVP release if critical path features overrun their allocated time. Maintain a prioritized backlog to facilitate quick decisions on scope reduction.","Track sprint velocity and burndown charts weekly. If a high-complexity epic is projected to exceed its allocated time by more than 20% after the first sprint of work, the contingency plan is activated.","Project Manager","2025-02-10","Not Started"
