"TEST-SEC-001","Security & Multi-Tenancy","Security","Integration","Critical","true","High","Verify strict data isolation between tenants. A user from Tenant A must be explicitly denied access to any data from Tenant B.","Critical - A failure represents a complete breach of the multi-tenant architecture and a catastrophic data leak.","High","Two separate tenants (Tenant A, Tenant B) exist. A user account exists in Tenant A. A known data document (e.g., an attendance record) exists in Tenant B.","1. Authenticate as the user from Tenant A. 2. Using the authenticated Firebase SDK, attempt a direct 'get' request for the known document ID from Tenant B. 3. Verify the request fails.","The SDK call must return a 'permission-denied' error.
