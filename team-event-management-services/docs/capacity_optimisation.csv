"Cross-training","High specialization, creating key person dependencies (RISK-007).","Schedule 4 hours per sprint for pair programming sessions between frontend and backend leads on critical tasks like security rules and state management.","Reduces single-point-of-failure risk by 30%. Increases team velocity by 10% in later sprints.","8","Ongoing","At least 2 developers are comfortable reviewing and making minor changes to both frontend and backend codebases.","Avoids an estimated 4-week delay if a lead developer becomes unavailable."
"Meeting Overhead Reduction","15% of capacity (12 hours/sprint/person) is allocated to meetings.","Consolidate status updates into a single daily stand-up and use asynchronous communication for non-urgent topics. Move one recurring weekly meeting to bi-weekly.","Frees up 4 hours of focus time per developer per sprint, increasing effective capacity by 5%.","","Immediate","Meeting time per person is reduced to <10% of total sprint hours.","Gains an additional 20 hours of development capacity per sprint for the 5-person core team."
"Automated Testing","QA is a mix of manual and automated, creating a bottleneck for release validation.","Dedicate QA Engineer's buffer capacity (24 hours/sprint) exclusively to increasing E2E test automation coverage for critical paths (Login, Registration, Check-in).","Reduces regression testing time by 50% by Sprint 6.","","Sprints 2-6","80% of critical path scenarios are covered by automated E2E tests.","Saves 40 hours of manual regression testing per release cycle."
