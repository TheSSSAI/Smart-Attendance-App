"RISK-001","Technical","The requirement for selectable data residency (US-003) introduces extreme architectural complexity, which could lead to a catastrophic compliance breach.","High","Critical","[""US-003""]","4","Mandate a formal architectural design spike and review before implementation. Build a proof-of-concept.","De-scope the initial launch to a single, pre-defined region and defer multi-region support.","Architectural spike fails to produce a viable implementation plan within one sprint.","40000","4 weeks for spike and POC"
"RISK-002","Technical","Over-reliance on a complex, monolithic set of Firestore Security Rules increases the probability of a misconfiguration leading to data leakage between tenants.","Medium","Critical","[""All data access tasks""]","","Enforce 95%+ test coverage for all security rules using the Firebase Emulator Suite. All rule changes require approval from two senior engineers.","Maintain a pre-written, highly restrictive 'lockdown' ruleset for immediate deployment in case of a vulnerability.","A security rule unit test fails in the CI/CD pipeline.","","Ongoing"
"RISK-003","Quality","Reporting features (US-059, US-061) will have extremely slow performance or fail entirely for large tenants if not backed by a pre-aggregation strategy.","High","High","[""US-059"",""US-060"",""US-061"",""US-062"",""US-063""]","3","Mandate a server-side data aggregation strategy from the outset using scheduled Cloud Functions to create daily summaries.","Limit reporting scope to short, fixed date ranges (e.g., 'last 7 days') for initial release.","Load tests against reporting queries exceed the 3-second performance NFR.","10000","3 weeks to implement aggregation pipeline"
"RISK-004","Resource","High key-person dependency on the Senior Backend Developer, creating a single point of failure for critical architecture and security tasks.","High","High","[""All High/Critical complexity backend tasks""]","8","Enforce mandatory pair programming for all 'High' complexity backend tasks. Actively cross-train the Full-Stack developer.","Allocate budget for an on-demand external Firebase consultant.","Over 80% of critical backend tasks are assigned to the same individual over two consecutive sprints.","20000","Ongoing"
"RISK-005","Technical","Offline data synchronization (US-034) is subject to inconsistent OS background processing rules, which could lead to data loss.","Medium","Critical","[""US-033"",""US-034"",""US-035"",""US-036""]","2","Implement a robust auxiliary local database (e.g., Drift) to reliably track pending write timestamps. Conduct extensive E2E testing on physical devices.","Pivot design to guarantee sync only when the app is in the foreground, with prominent UI indicators for pending syncs.","E2E automated tests show a data loss rate > 0.5% in simulated network-loss scenarios.","5000","2 weeks for enhanced local DB implementation"
"RISK-006","Operational","The automated tenant hard-delete function is an extremely high-risk operation. A bug could lead to accidental, irreversible deletion of active customer data.","Low","Critical","[""US-022""]","","The function must run in 'dry run' mode by default. It must have redundant safety checks. Requires sign-off from two senior engineers.","Immediately invoke the Disaster Recovery plan to restore from the last daily backup.","A 'dry run' of the deletion function logs an incorrect tenant for deletion.","","1 week for implementation of safeguards"
"RISK-007","Operational","Inefficient Firestore queries in scheduled functions or abuse of public endpoints (e.g., SMS pumping) can lead to significant GCP cost overruns.","High","Medium","[""US-086"",""US-087"",""US-018""]","1","Implement strict GCP budget alerts. Enforce code reviews for all queries in scheduled functions. Implement Firebase App Check on all public endpoints.","Temporarily disable the highest-cost scheduled function while re-architecting its queries.","A GCP budget alert fires indicating projected spend will exceed the budget.","10000","Ongoing"
