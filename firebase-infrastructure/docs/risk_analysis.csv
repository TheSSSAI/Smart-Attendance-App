"RISK-001","Technical","The requirement for selectable data residency (REQ-1-024, US-003) introduces extreme architectural complexity. An incorrect implementation of the project-per-region or multi-database model could lead to a catastrophic compliance breach, storing tenant data in the wrong geographic location.","4","5","20","High","WI-002-01-03 (Implement Function for Data Residency Selection), EPIC-002 (Tenant & User Lifecycle Management)","Complex architectural requirements to meet strict data sovereignty regulations, which are not natively simple to implement in a standard Firebase project.","Mandate a formal architectural design spike and review board approval before implementation. Build a proof-of-concept with two regions to validate the deployment, data routing, and tenant provisioning logic.","If the multi-region architecture proves too complex for the initial timeline, de-scope the initial launch to a single, pre-defined region and defer multi-region support to a future release.","The architectural design spike fails to produce a viable, testable, and secure implementation plan within the allocated sprint.","Tech Lead / Architect","2024-11-15","Not Started"
"RISK-002","Technical","The security model relies entirely on a complex set of Firestore Security Rules (REQ-1-025, REQ-1-068). As features and roles are added, the ruleset's complexity will grow, increasing the probability of a misconfiguration that could lead to data leakage between tenants or improper access within a tenant.","3","5","15","High","WI-002-03-02 (Implement Security Rules for Team Management) and all tasks involving data access.","Over-reliance on a single, monolithic declarative security mechanism which becomes difficult to manage and test exhaustively at scale.","Enforce a mandatory 95%+ test coverage for all security rules using the Firebase Emulator Suite. All pull requests modifying `firestore.rules` must require approval from at least two designated senior backend engineers. Develop a modular rule structure using functions.","Maintain a pre-written, highly restrictive 'lockdown' ruleset that can be deployed immediately in case a vulnerability is discovered, blocking all client access while a patch is developed.","A security rule unit test fails in the CI/CD pipeline, or a manual or automated security audit discovers a potential data access flaw.","Backend Lead","2024-12-01","Not Started"
"RISK-003","Quality","Reporting features (US-059, US-061, etc.) depend on complex, multi-field Firestore queries. If not backed by pre-aggregated data and correct composite indexes, these queries will fail to scale, leading to extremely slow performance or query failures for tenants with large data volumes, making a key feature unusable.","4","4","16","High","WI-004-01-03 (Implement All Admin Report Views), WI-004-01-02 (Define and Deploy Composite Indexes for Reporting)","Firestore is not an analytical database; performing complex aggregations on raw transactional data at read-time is inefficient and costly.","Mandate a server-side data aggregation strategy from the outset. Implement a scheduled Cloud Function to compute and store daily summaries in a separate, optimized collection. All reports must query this pre-aggregated data, not the raw attendance records.","For the initial release, limit the scope of reporting to shorter, fixed date ranges (e.g., 'last 7 days') to reduce query complexity if the full aggregation pipeline is delayed.","Load tests against the reporting queries in the emulator (with 10,000+ seeded records) exceed the 3-second performance NFR.","Backend Lead","2025-01-10","Not Started"
"RISK-004","Resource","The project requires a broad and deep skill set across Flutter (Mobile/Web), advanced Firebase/GCP backend services, and DevOps. There is a high probability of key-person dependency on one or two engineers with this full-stack serverless expertise, creating a single point of failure.","4","4","16","High","All high-complexity tasks, especially WI-001-02-01 (CI/CD for Backend), WI-002-01-02 (Tenant Registration Function), and WI-002-04-03 (Tenant Deletion Lifecycle).","Concentration of critical, complex architectural knowledge in a small number of team members.","Enforce mandatory pair programming for all 'High' complexity backend and DevOps tasks. Mandate comprehensive technical documentation for all architectural decisions. Actively cross-train at least one other engineer on CI/CD pipeline management and core backend functions.","Allocate a budget for bringing in an on-demand external consultant specializing in Firebase architecture if a key person becomes unavailable for an extended period.","A review of sprint task assignments shows that over 80% of critical backend/DevOps tasks are consistently assigned to the same individual over two consecutive sprints.","Engineering Manager","2024-11-20","Not Started"
"RISK-005","Technical","Offline data synchronization (REQ-1-009, US-034) is subject to strict and inconsistent OS background processing rules, especially on iOS. This could lead to significant delays in data sync, user confusion, and potential data loss if the 24-hour notification system (US-035) is not perfectly implemented.","3","5","15","High","WI-003-01-03 (Implement Offline Attendance Marking), WI-003-01-04 (Implement Persistent Sync Failure Notification)","The reliability of the core offline feature is dependent on external mobile operating systems whose behavior is outside the project's control.","Implement a robust auxiliary local database (e.g., Drift) to reliably track pending write timestamps. Conduct extensive E2E testing on a wide range of physical iOS and Android devices to characterize real-world background sync behavior. Clearly document limitations for the user.","If fully automatic background sync proves unreliable on iOS, pivot the design to guarantee sync only when the app is in the foreground, with very prominent UI indicators for pending syncs.","E2E automated tests show a data loss or sync failure rate greater than 0.5% in simulated network-loss scenarios on iOS.","Mobile Lead","2025-01-15","Not Started"
"RISK-006","Operational","The automated tenant hard-delete function (WI-002-04-03) is an extremely high-risk operation. A bug in its query logic (e.g., missing status check, incorrect date comparison) could lead to the accidental, irreversible deletion of active customer data, which would be a business-ending event.","2","5","10","Medium","WI-002-04-03 (Implement Tenant Deletion Lifecycle)","Implementation of a powerful, automated, and destructive process without sufficient safeguards.","The deletion function must run in 'dry run' mode by default, logging only what it *would* delete. It must be manually switched to 'wet run' mode. The query must have redundant safety checks (e.g., `status == 'pending_deletion'` AND `deletionScheduledAt < now()`). Require sign-off from two senior engineers on this specific function's code.","Immediately invoke the Disaster Recovery plan to restore the affected tenant's data from the last daily backup (RPO 24 hours).","A 'dry run' of the deletion function logs that it would delete a tenant whose status is not 'pending_deletion' or whose grace period has not expired.","Backend Lead / DevOps","2025-02-01","Not Started"
"RISK-007","Operational","Inefficient Firestore queries, especially in scheduled functions that iterate across many tenants/users (e.g., anonymization, auto-checkout), can lead to unexpected and significant GCP cost overruns. Abuse of public endpoints (e.g., SMS pumping on OTP auth) can also cause high costs.","4","3","12","Medium","WI-002-04-04 (Anonymization), WI-002-04-03 (Deletion), US-018 (Phone OTP)","The pay-per-operation model of serverless platforms can lead to high costs if not carefully managed and optimized.","Implement strict GCP budget alerts with notifications. Enforce code reviews for all queries in scheduled functions to check for efficiency. Implement Firebase App Check and rate-limiting on all public-facing endpoints, especially for phone authentication.","Temporarily disable the highest-cost scheduled function while re-architecting its queries (e.g., switch from a query-based to an event-driven approach).","A GCP budget alert fires, indicating that projected spend is on track to exceed the monthly budget by more than 10%.","Tech Lead","2024-11-25","Not Started"
