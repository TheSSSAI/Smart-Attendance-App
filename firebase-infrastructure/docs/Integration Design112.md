## 1.2 Relevant Requirements

### 1.2.1 Requirement Id

#### 1.2.1.1 Requirement Id

REQ-1-072

#### 1.2.1.2 Requirement Text

All backend configurations, including Firestore security rules, database indexes, and Cloud Functions definitions, must be managed as code in the repository and deployed using the Firebase CLI (Infrastructure as Code).

#### 1.2.1.3 Validation Criteria

- Code review confirms that changes to security rules or indexes are made in the firestore.rules and firestore.indexes.json files, not manually in the console.

#### 1.2.1.4 Implementation Implications

- This repository must contain a firebase.json file that configures the deployment of Firestore rules and indexes.
- A firestore.rules file must be created to contain the entire security ruleset.
- A firestore.indexes.json file must be created to define all composite indexes required by application queries.
- A CI/CD pipeline must be configured to use the Firebase CLI to deploy the contents of this repository.

#### 1.2.1.5 Extraction Reasoning

This requirement is the primary justification for the existence of the firebase-infrastructure repository. The repository's sole purpose is to fulfill this Infrastructure as Code (IaC) mandate for Firebase configurations.

### 1.2.2.0 Requirement Id

#### 1.2.2.1 Requirement Id

REQ-1-025

#### 1.2.2.2 Requirement Text

The primary mechanism for enforcing multi-tenant data segregation shall be Firestore Security Rules. Upon authentication, each user's ID token must contain a tenantId custom claim. All database security rules must use this claim to ensure that read and write operations are restricted to documents associated with the user's own tenant.

#### 1.2.2.3 Validation Criteria

- Write a Firestore security rule that allows access only if request.auth.token.tenantId == resource.data.tenantId.

#### 1.2.2.4 Implementation Implications

- The firestore.rules file must implement a root-level match block that enforces a check between the JWT's tenantId claim and the tenantId field on the resource being accessed.
- This rule forms the foundation of the multi-tenant security model.

#### 1.2.2.5 Extraction Reasoning

This is a core, non-negotiable security requirement that must be implemented within the firestore.rules file contained in this repository. It defines the multi-tenancy enforcement mechanism.

### 1.2.3.0 Requirement Id

#### 1.2.3.1 Requirement Id

REQ-1-068

#### 1.2.3.2 Requirement Text

The system's data access logic must be enforced primarily through Firestore Security Rules. The ruleset must be comprehensive and cover the following cases: 1) A user's access must be strictly confined to documents associated with their tenantId custom claim. 2) A user with the 'Supervisor' role can only read/write data of users who have that Supervisor's userId in their supervisorId field. 3) A user with the 'Subordinate' role can only read/write their own user document and associated data (e.g., their own attendance records).

#### 1.2.3.3 Validation Criteria

- Write unit tests for security rules that simulate a Supervisor attempting to read data from a user not in their team and verify access is denied.

#### 1.2.3.4 Implementation Implications

- The firestore.rules file must contain specific rule blocks for different collections (e.g., /users, /attendance).
- These rules must check the role custom claim from the auth token (request.auth.token.role).
- Rules for the 'Supervisor' role will involve cross-document reads (get()) to verify the supervisorId relationship.

#### 1.2.3.5 Extraction Reasoning

This requirement provides the detailed specification for the Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) logic that must be implemented in the firestore.rules file.

### 1.2.4.0 Requirement Id

#### 1.2.4.1 Requirement Id

REQ-1-028

#### 1.2.4.2 Requirement Text

The system shall maintain an auditLog collection in Firestore for recording critical actions. This collection must be configured to be immutable. Firestore Security Rules must be written to explicitly deny all update and delete operations on any document within the /auditLog/ path, regardless of the user's role.

#### 1.2.4.3 Validation Criteria

- Write Firestore security rules that prevent update and delete on the auditLog collection.

#### 1.2.4.4 Implementation Implications

- A specific rule block for the auditLog collection must be added to firestore.rules.
- This block must contain 'allow update, delete: if false;' to enforce immutability.

#### 1.2.4.5 Extraction Reasoning

This is a specific, critical security requirement that translates directly to a concrete implementation within the firestore.rules file managed by this repository.

It is fulfilled when this repository's artifacts are deployed to the Firebase environment via a CI/CD pipeline.", 'The contract is consumed by all other application components, as their security and performance depend on the successful deployment of the rules and indexes defined here.', 'Changes to this repository must be deployed before or in coordination with changes in consuming repositories that depend on new indexes or security rules.'], 'extraction_reasoning': "This repository does not expose a runtime API. Its 'contract' is the declarative infrastructure it provides. All other application components are 'consumers' of this deployed infrastructure. The integration happens at deployment time and through the runtime enforcement by the Firebase platform itself."}

## 1.7.0.0 Technology Context

### 1.7.1.0 Framework Requirements

The repository must be structured as a valid Firebase project, utilizing the Firebase CLI for all deployment operations. The primary outputs are `firestore.rules` and `firestore.indexes.json` files.

### 1.7.2.0 Integration Technologies

- Firebase CLI: Used by the CI/CD pipeline to deploy the infrastructure configurations.
- Firestore Security Rules Language: The language for defining data access policies.
- JSON: The format for defining Firestore indexes.
- @firebase/rules-unit-testing: The library used by test suites to validate security rules against an emulated Firestore instance.

### 1.7.3.0 Performance Constraints

The `firestore.indexes.json` file must contain definitions for all composite indexes required by application queries to prevent query failures and ensure low-latency data retrieval. Rule logic must be optimized to minimize cross-document reads (`get()` calls) to control costs and latency.

### 1.7.4.0 Security Requirements

The `firestore.rules` file is the most critical security artifact. It must implement a Zero Trust model, enforcing strict tenant isolation and role-based permissions for every data access operation as specified in security requirements.
