"Cross-training & Risk Mitigation","High key-person dependency on Senior Backend Developer (RISK-004) and DevOps skills (RISK-001).","Implement a formal pair programming schedule where the Full-Stack Developer pairs with the Backend Developer on all 'High' and 'Critical' complexity backend tasks. Allocate 10% of the Frontend Developer's capacity to learning basic Cloud Function deployment.","Reduces key-person dependency by 40% over 3 months. Increases team bus factor from 1 to 2 for critical backend systems.","80","12 weeks","Full-Stack Developer can independently lead a high-complexity backend story. Frontend Developer can deploy a minor Cloud Function change.","Mitigates risk of project delays worth an estimated $100,000 if key person is unavailable."
"Reporting Performance & Cost","Reporting features are designed to query raw data, which will not scale and will be costly (RISK-003).","Immediately pivot the architecture for all reporting stories (US-059, US-061, US-062) to use a server-side aggregation pattern. Create a new epic for a scheduled Cloud Function that populates a `dailySummaries` collection.","Reduces query costs by >90% for summary reports. Ensures report load times remain under 3 seconds regardless of data volume.","40","2 weeks","Reporting queries read from the new aggregated collection. Load tests with 1M records still meet performance NFRs.","Avoids projected Firestore query costs of over $5,000/month at scale."
