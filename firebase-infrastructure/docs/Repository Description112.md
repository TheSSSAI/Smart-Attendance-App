# 3 Description

This repository contains all the Infrastructure as Code (IaC) for the entire Firebase/GCP project. Decomposed from the 'attendance-app-backend', this repository is not a service, but a declarative definition of the environment. It includes the complete Firestore Security Ruleset, which is the cornerstone of the application's security, enforcing multi-tenancy and RBAC. It also defines all necessary Firestore indexes for query performance and the configuration for other Firebase services. Separating the IaC into its own repository treats the infrastructure definition as a first-class citizen, allowing it to be versioned, reviewed, and deployed independently of the application code that runs on it. This provides a clear separation of concerns between infrastructure management and feature development.

# 20.0.0 Decomposition Rationale

## 20.1.0 Operation Type

NEW_DECOMPOSED

## 20.2.0 Source Repository

REPO-BACKEND-002

## 20.3.0 Decomposition Reasoning

Treats the application's infrastructure (security rules, database indexes) as code that should be versioned and deployed independently. This separation allows infrastructure specialists or a platform team to manage the environment's state without needing to understand or redeploy application logic.

## 20.4.0 Extracted Responsibilities

- Firestore Security Rules definition (`firestore.rules`).
- Firestore composite index definitions (`firestore.indexes.json`).
- Firebase project configuration (`firebase.json`).

## 20.5.0 Reusability Scope

- Specific to this project's infrastructure.

## 20.6.0 Development Benefits

- Clear separation of infrastructure and application code.
- Enables automated, reliable, and repeatable environment setup.
- Allows security rules to be audited and deployed separately from features.

# 25.0.0 Scope Boundaries

## 25.1.0 Must Implement

- Complete, non-overlapping security rules for all collections.
- All composite indexes required by the application.

## 25.2.0 Must Not Implement

- Any TypeScript/JavaScript application logic.

## 25.3.0 Extension Points

- New rules and indexes are added here as new features are developed.
