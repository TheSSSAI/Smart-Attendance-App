Requires deep understanding of Firestore transactions and compensation patterns.","Not recommended for non-senior developers due to high risk of data corruption.","Potential for race conditions or partial failures leaving orphaned data (RISK-001).","Implement with Firestore transactions and write extensive integration tests simulating failures.","0.95","0.63","0.32","2",""
"TASK-026","[Mobile] Implement Offline Attendance Capability","Flutter","Firebase SDK,Offline Persistence","High","12","Senior","1.2","10","1","","TASK-025","true","Medium","4","Complex state management and interaction with Firestore's offline cache. High risk of silent data loss (RISK-004).","Could be split between two mid-level developers, increasing coordination overhead.","Platform-specific background limitations, complexity of testing various network states.","Rigorous E2E testing on physical devices, implement robust logging for sync failures.","1.8","1.2","0.6","4","2"

A single error could compromise the entire platform's data isolation.","Not recommended. Requires a dedicated security expert or the most senior backend developer.","Complexity of multi-tenant RBAC logic can lead to subtle, catastrophic vulnerabilities.","100% test coverage for security rules, peer review by another senior developer, external security audit if possible.","4.8","3.2","1.6","8","4"
