"Cross-training","Senior developers are bottlenecks for architecture and security reviews.","Formalize a cross-training plan: backend.dev.2 to pair with backend.dev.1 on security rules (TASK-029). frontend.dev.2 to pair with frontend.dev.1 on Flutter Web architecture (Admin Dashboard tasks).","Reduces key-person dependency (RISK-006) by 30% and improves team velocity by 15% in later sprints.","80","8 weeks","At least two developers can confidently review and modify critical components (security rules, web architecture).","Mitigates risk of project delay worth an estimated $80,000."
"Performance Engineering","Reporting features (US-059) are at high risk of poor performance and high cost (RISK-003).","Prioritize the implementation of the server-side aggregation function (TASK-043) early. Shift from client-side aggregation to server-side pre-calculation for all dashboard metrics.","Ensures reporting dashboards are performant (<3s load time) and cost-effective for tenants with >1000 users.","16","Sprint 4","P95 load time for the Admin Summary Report is under 3 seconds in a load-tested environment.","Prevents costly Firestore query refactoring and potential customer churn due to poor performance."
"Test Automation","QA is a potential bottleneck, especially for security and complex E2E flows.","Allocate developer time to assist QA (qa.engineer.1) in building out the automated security rule test suite (TASK-030) and E2E tests for the offline workflow.","Increases test velocity and allows QA to focus on exploratory and manual testing. Reduces regression risk by 40%.","40","Sprints 3-4","Security rule test suite runs automatically in CI/CD. E2E offline test is automated.","Reduces manual regression testing time by an estimated 20 hours per sprint."
