"RISK-001","Technical","A flaw in the complex Firestore Security Rules could lead to a catastrophic data leak, allowing users from one tenant to access data from another. This represents the most significant security threat to the platform.","3","5","15","High","Implementation of Firestore Security Rules for Multi-Tenancy and RBAC (WI-007, WI-008). This risk affects the security of all data-handling work items.","The inherent complexity of writing and maintaining a large, multi-tenant RBAC ruleset. A single logical error could create a widespread vulnerability.","Implement a 'default deny' security posture. Develop a comprehensive, automated test suite for security rules using the Firebase Emulator, covering all cross-tenant and role-based access scenarios. Mandate peer review of all `firestore.rules` changes by a designated security lead.","A documented incident response plan that includes immediate deployment of a highly restrictive 'lockdown' ruleset, followed by a post-mortem analysis and notification to affected tenants.","Any failed security rule test in the CI/CD pipeline. An anomalous spike in 'permission-denied' errors in production logs, which could indicate probing or a misconfiguration.","Backend Lead","2025-02-15","Not Started"
"RISK-002","External","The automated Google Sheets export, a key feature for paid tiers, fails due to the complexity of the OAuth 2.0 flow, token management, or unannounced changes in the Google Sheets API. This would lead to customer dissatisfaction and data gaps.","4","4","16","High","Implementation of Google Sheets Export Cloud Function and Setup UI (WI-022, WI-023).","High dependency on a complex, external third-party service with its own potential for downtime, API changes, and complex authentication mechanisms.","Develop robust error handling and user-facing recovery workflows (as per US-067, US-068). Store refresh tokens securely in Google Secret Manager. Implement comprehensive monitoring and alerting for the export function's error rate.","The system must queue records that failed to export and automatically include them in the next successful run to prevent data loss. Document a manual export procedure for Admins as a last resort.","A Cloud Monitoring alert fires if the `google_sheets_export` function error rate exceeds 1%. A notable increase in Firestore documents indicating a 'sync_error' status.","Integration Specialist","2025-03-01","Not Started"
"RISK-003","Technical","Inefficient Firestore queries for reporting and dashboards lead to poor application performance (slow load times) and high operational costs, making the application unusable for large tenants.","4","4","16","High","All reporting and dashboard features, especially WI-017 (Supervisor Dashboard) and the reporting user stories (US-059, US-060, US-061, US-062, US-063).","Lack of proper composite indexes for complex filtering, or attempting large-scale data aggregation on the client-side instead of using server-side processing.","Enforce a strict policy of managing all Firestore indexes via the `firestore.indexes.json` file (IaC). Use the Firestore query profiler during development. For complex reports, use scheduled Cloud Functions to pre-aggregate data into summary collections.","If a report is unacceptably slow in production, disable the feature temporarily while a hotfix is developed. The hotfix would involve deploying the correct index or a new aggregation function.","Firestore Slow Query logs are detected in Google Cloud Logging. Firebase Performance Monitoring metrics for specific screen load times exceed the 3-second threshold.","Backend Lead","2025-02-20","Not Started"
"RISK-004","Quality","Silent loss of user attendance data due to a failure in the custom logic for detecting and notifying about persistent offline sync failures. This would break the core value proposition of the app and destroy user trust.","3","5","15","High","Implementation of Offline Capability and Persistent Sync Failure Notification (WI-014, WI-015).","The Firestore SDK's offline cache is a black box, necessitating a complex custom solution with an auxiliary local database to track the age of unsynced records, which introduces its own potential for bugs.","Implement rigorous E2E testing for the offline workflow, including tests that manipulate device time and network connectivity. The UI for manual retry (US-036) provides a user-driven recovery path. Log sync failures to a remote logging service for proactive monitoring.","Provide Admins with a tool to manually enter attendance records on behalf of users who report data loss. The support team must have a runbook for investigating sync failures based on logs.","A user reports seeing the 'Sync Failed' banner but is unable to resolve it. An increase in support tickets related to missing attendance records.","Mobile Lead","2025-03-10","Not Started"
"RISK-005","Operational","A misconfiguration in the CI/CD pipeline (GitHub Actions) leads to the deployment of an incorrect version of code or configuration to the production environment, causing downtime, data corruption, or a security breach.","3","5","15","High","All CI/CD workflow setup tasks (WI-032, WI-033, WI-034). This risk affects the stability of the entire production system.","The complexity of managing environment-specific variables, secrets, and platform-specific signing credentials within YAML-based workflows.","Use GitHub branch protection rules for `main` and `develop` branches, requiring status checks and approvals. Use Workload Identity Federation for secure, keyless authentication to GCP. Store all secrets in GitHub's encrypted secrets storage. Automate iOS code signing.","Maintain a documented manual deployment process for emergencies. Implement a quick rollback strategy by redeploying a previously known good commit/tag.","Any failed deployment job in the GitHub Actions workflow. Post-deployment smoke tests failing. A sudden spike in application errors in Cloud Monitoring post-deployment.","DevOps Lead","2025-02-28","Not Started"
"RISK-006","Resource","Project timeline and quality are heavily dependent on a small number of developers with a rare combination of skills (Flutter, advanced Firebase, TypeScript, GCP), creating a key-person dependency risk.","3","4","12","Medium","All high and critical complexity work items, especially those involving backend security (WI-007) and complex integrations (WI-022).","The specialized and tightly integrated technology stack requires deep expertise across multiple domains, which is not easily interchangeable among team members.","Enforce pair programming on critical components. Mandate high-quality, comprehensive documentation for all complex logic and infrastructure setup. Implement a formal cross-training program to spread knowledge across the team.","Maintain a pre-vetted list of third-party contractors or consultants with the required expertise who can be engaged on short notice if a key team member becomes unavailable.","Pull request review times consistently exceed 24 hours. A single developer becomes the sole owner of a critical system component with no backup.","Project Manager","2025-02-10","Not Started"
"RISK-007","Quality","Failure to consistently meet and test for WCAG 2.1 Level AA accessibility standards across the mobile and web applications, resulting in a product that is unusable for users with disabilities and creating legal compliance risks.","4","3","12","Medium","All UI-related work items (e.g., WI-002, WI-011, WI-017, WI-023).","Accessibility is often treated as an afterthought and requires specialized knowledge and diligent manual testing that can be easily overlooked under timeline pressure.","Integrate automated accessibility checks into the CI pipeline. Create a formal accessibility checklist based on WCAG AA that must be completed for every pull request containing UI changes. Conduct regular manual testing with screen readers (TalkBack/VoiceOver).","Allocate a dedicated 'accessibility debt' sprint post-launch to address any identified gaps or reported issues from users.","An automated accessibility scan in the CI pipeline fails. Negative feedback from a manual accessibility audit or user report.","Frontend Lead","2025-03-15","Not Started"
"RISK-008","Operational","A bug in the irreversible Tenant Deletion Cloud Function (WI-006) causes the permanent deletion of the wrong tenant's data or fails to delete all data, leading to catastrophic data loss or a data retention compliance failure.","2","5","10","Medium","Implementation of Tenant Deletion Workflow (WI-006).","The destructive and irreversible nature of the operation, combined with the complexity of fanning out deletions across multiple collections for a specific tenant.","The function MUST re-verify the tenant's status as 'pending_deletion' in a transaction before proceeding. Implement a 'dry run' mode that logs all documents it would delete. Require manual review of the dry run log before enabling destructive mode. Implement extensive integration testing for the entire deletion and cancellation lifecycle.","Restore the affected tenant's data from the last daily backup. This is a last resort and will result in up to 24 hours of data loss (RPO).","An alert fires if the deletion function's runtime exceeds an expected threshold. The dry run log shows an unexpected number or type of documents targeted for deletion.","Backend Lead","2025-03-20","Not Started"
