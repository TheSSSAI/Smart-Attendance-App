"Phase 1: Foundational Security & Core Logic","High","4","80","Jest + Firebase Emulator Suite","200","Very High - Enables CI/CD quality gates and prevents critical security/data integrity bugs.","4 hours/month","8","CI integration for automated test execution.","95% of security rules covered; CI pipeline blocks merge on test failure.","Emulator setup complexity.","Pair programming; Standardized setup scripts.","Ensures the core platform is secure and reliable from the start."
"Phase 2: Critical Path E2E & Mobile Workflows","High","6","50","Flutter `integration_test` + Firebase Test Lab","250","High - Reduces manual regression testing effort by 70% for mobile releases.","10 hours/month","16","Firebase Test Lab configuration; Device farm access.","Core workflows (Login, Check-in/out, Offline Sync, Approval) are fully automated.","Test flakiness due to UI changes and network conditions.","Implement retry logic; Use stable test IDs; Mock network responses where possible.","Increases release velocity and confidence for the mobile application."
"Phase 3: Admin Dashboard & Reporting","Medium","8","100","Flutter `integration_test` for Web","300","Medium - Automates complex filtering and data validation scenarios that are time-consuming to test manually.","15 hours/month","8","Browser automation grid setup (e.g., Selenium Grid or cloud provider).","80% of admin reporting features are covered by automated tests.","High maintenance due to frequent UI changes in the dashboard.","Focus automation on data validation rather than pixel-perfect UI tests; Use component-based testing.","Ensures data accuracy and functionality of key administrative tools."
