"RISK-001","Skill Gap","A flaw in complex Firestore Security Rules could lead to a catastrophic data leak. This requires specialized, senior-level expertise.","Medium","Critical","[""TASK-029"",""TASK-030""]","4","Dedicate senior backend dev (backend.dev.1) exclusively to this task and its review. Implement a comprehensive automated test suite (TASK-030) before any feature goes live.","Engage a third-party Firebase security consultant for a one-time audit.","Security rule test coverage drops below 90% in CI/CD pipeline.","20000","4 weeks to implement and validate."
"RISK-006","Key Person Dependency","Project relies heavily on a small number of senior developers with specialized skills (Flutter Web, Firebase Security), creating a single point of failure.","Medium","High","[""TASK-003"",""TASK-026"",""TASK-029"",""TASK-043""]","6","Mandate pair programming on all 'High' and 'Critical' complexity tasks. Enforce strict documentation standards for architecture and complex logic.","Maintain a pre-vetted list of contractors with matching skill sets.","A critical component is owned by a single developer with no backup for two consecutive sprints.","","Ongoing."
"RISK-004","Quality","Silent loss of offline user data due to bugs in the complex sync failure detection logic. This would destroy user trust.","Medium","Critical","[""TASK-026""]","","Allocate extra QA time for rigorous manual E2E testing of offline scenarios on physical devices. Implement robust client-side logging for sync events.","Provide Admins a tool to manually insert attendance records on behalf of users.","Increase in support tickets related to 'missing' attendance records.","5000","2 weeks for additional testing cycle."
