# 2 Name

client-data-access

# 3 Description

A shared client-side library containing the data access layer for the Flutter applications. Decomposed from the original 'attendance-app-client', it implements the Repository Pattern. This repository provides a clean, abstract API for all interactions with the Firebase backend, encapsulating the specifics of querying Firestore and invoking Callable Functions. It handles the logic for data serialization/deserialization (from Firestore documents to Dart models) and manages the complexities of offline data handling via Firestore's offline persistence. By abstracting data operations, it decouples the UI/feature logic from the backend data source, making the feature code cleaner, more testable, and resilient to changes in the backend implementation.

# 20.0.0 Decomposition Rationale

## 20.1.0 Operation Type

NEW_DECOMPOSED

## 20.2.0 Source Repository

REPO-CLIENT-001

## 20.3.0 Decomposition Reasoning

Implements the Data Layer of a Clean Architecture. It extracts and centralizes all client-side data fetching and persistence logic, decoupling the UI and business logic from the data source (Firebase). This makes the UI code simpler and allows for easier testing by mocking the repositories.

## 20.4.0 Extracted Responsibilities

- Implementation of the Repository Pattern for all entities.
- Firestore query and Callable Function invocation logic.
- Data serialization/deserialization (mapping).
- Offline data handling configuration.

## 20.5.0 Reusability Scope

- Consumed by both the mobile and web admin applications.

## 20.6.0 Development Benefits

- Promotes a clean, testable application architecture.
- Decouples UI from data sources.
- Centralizes data access logic for easier maintenance.
