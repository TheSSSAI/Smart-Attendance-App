# 2 Repository Analysis

## 2.1 Repository Definition

### 2.1.1 Scope Boundaries

- Implements the Repository Pattern for the Flutter client, acting as the sole data access layer.
- Abstracts all interactions with the Firebase backend, including Firestore queries and Callable Function invocations.
- Manages data serialization/deserialization between Firestore documents (Map<String, dynamic>) and pure Dart domain models.
- Encapsulates the logic for handling offline data persistence and synchronization by leveraging the Firebase SDK's capabilities.

### 2.1.2 Technology Stack

- Flutter
- Dart
- Riverpod (for dependency injection of repositories)
- Firebase SDK (Firestore, Cloud Functions)

### 2.1.3 Architectural Constraints

- Must adhere to the Clean Architecture pattern, serving as the 'Data' layer and being depended upon by the 'Domain' layer.
- All data access must be asynchronous, utilizing Dart's Future and Stream APIs to prevent blocking the UI thread.
- Must maintain persistence ignorance in the domain layer by exposing abstract repository interfaces (contracts).

### 2.1.5.0.0 Analysis Insights

This repository is the cornerstone of the client application's architecture. Its successful implementation is critical for testability, maintainability, and enabling core features like offline support. The design must prioritize a clear separation between data sources (raw Firebase calls), models (DTOs), and repository implementations that orchestrate them.

# 3.0.0.0.0 Requirements Mapping

## 3.1.0.0.0 Functional Requirements

### 3.1.1.0.0 Requirement Id

#### 3.1.1.1.0 Requirement Id

REQ-1-042

#### 3.1.1.2.0 Requirement Description

System must capture client timestamp and GPS to create a new 'pending' attendance document in Firestore upon check-in.

#### 3.1.1.3.0 Implementation Implications

- Requires a method in the AttendanceRepository like 'Future<void> createAttendanceRecord(AttendanceRecord record) T'.
- The repository implementation will construct the Firestore document map from the Dart model and use the 'firestore.collection('...').add()' method.

#### 3.1.1.4.0 Required Components

- AttendanceRepository
- FirebaseAttendanceDataSource

#### 3.1.1.5.0 Analysis Reasoning

This requirement directly defines a primary write operation that must be encapsulated by the data access layer. The repository will handle the serialization and the call to the Firestore SDK.

### 3.1.2.0.0 Requirement Id

#### 3.1.2.1.0 Requirement Id

REQ-1-046

#### 3.1.2.2.0 Requirement Description

Offline attendance actions must be written to the local cache with an 'isOfflineEntry: true' flag.

#### 3.1.2.3.0 Implementation Implications

- The repository's 'createAttendanceRecord' method must be aware of the device's connectivity state.
- When offline, the 'AttendanceRecord' model passed to the repository must have its 'isOfflineEntry' flag set to true before being written to the local cache via the Firestore SDK.

#### 3.1.2.4.0 Required Components

- AttendanceRepository
- FirebaseAttendanceDataSource

#### 3.1.2.5.0 Analysis Reasoning

This requirement dictates specific logic within the repository to handle offline scenarios. It confirms that the repository is responsible for constructing the data model correctly before persistence, as detailed in Sequence Diagram 'SEQ ID 268'.

### 3.1.3.0.0 Requirement Id

#### 3.1.3.1.0 Requirement Id

Implied by multiple REQs

#### 3.1.3.2.0 Requirement Description

Fetch, filter, and stream data for various entities (attendance, events, users, teams) based on user role and context.

#### 3.1.3.3.0 Implementation Implications

- Requires methods like 'Stream<List<AttendanceRecord>> getPendingSubordinateRecords(String supervisorId)' and 'Stream<List<Event>> getEventsForUser(String userId, List<String> teamIds)'.
- Implementations will use Firestore's 'where()' and 'snapshots()' methods to create real-time data streams.

#### 3.1.3.4.0 Required Components

- AttendanceRepository
- EventRepository
- UserRepository
- TeamRepository

#### 3.1.3.5.0 Analysis Reasoning

Multiple requirements (e.g., REQ-1-005, REQ-1-017, REQ-1-019, REQ-1-057) and sequences (e.g., SEQ ID 269, 281) describe views that require filtered, real-time data from Firestore. The data access repository is the only appropriate place to encapsulate this query logic.

## 3.2.0.0.0 Non Functional Requirements

### 3.2.1.0.0 Requirement Type

#### 3.2.1.1.0 Requirement Type

Offline Capability

#### 3.2.1.2.0 Requirement Specification

Core functions must be supported offline, with data stored locally and synced automatically (REQ-1-009).

#### 3.2.1.3.0 Implementation Impact

The repository must be built on top of the Firebase SDK with offline persistence enabled. All write operations must be designed to work seamlessly with the local cache.

#### 3.2.1.4.0 Design Constraints

- The repository cannot implement custom offline logic; it must leverage the built-in Firestore SDK capabilities.
- Error handling must account for sync failures.

#### 3.2.1.5.0 Analysis Reasoning

This NFR is a primary driver for the repository's design. The choice of the Firebase SDK is directly tied to its robust offline persistence features, which this repository must utilize.

### 3.2.2.0.0 Requirement Type

#### 3.2.2.1.0 Requirement Type

Maintainability

#### 3.2.2.2.0 Requirement Specification

Codebase must follow a clean architecture pattern to ensure separation of concerns (REQ-1-072).

#### 3.2.2.3.0 Implementation Impact

The repository must be structured with clear interfaces (abstract classes) in a domain layer and concrete implementations in a separate data layer, adhering strictly to the dependency rule.

#### 3.2.2.4.0 Design Constraints

- Domain entities must be pure Dart objects with no dependency on Firebase.
- Data source-specific models (DTOs) must be used and mapped to domain entities.

#### 3.2.2.5.0 Analysis Reasoning

This NFR dictates the use of the Repository Pattern, which is the core identity of this 'client-data-access' library.

## 3.3.0.0.0 Requirements Analysis Summary

The repository is primarily driven by the need to provide a clean, testable, and offline-capable abstraction over the Firebase SDK. Requirements REQ-1-042 and REQ-1-046 are direct implementation directives, while the broader set of functional requirements implies a full suite of CRUD and query methods for all major domain entities.

# 4.0.0.0.0 Architecture Analysis

## 4.1.0.0.0 Architectural Patterns

### 4.1.1.0.0 Pattern Name

#### 4.1.1.1.0 Pattern Name

Repository Pattern

#### 4.1.1.2.0 Pattern Application

This library is the concrete implementation of the Repository Pattern. It mediates between the domain and data mapping layers using interfaces.

#### 4.1.1.3.0 Required Components

- Repository Interfaces (Abstract Classes)
- Repository Implementations
- Data Sources (Firebase SDK wrappers)
- Mappers (DTO to Domain Entity converters)

#### 4.1.1.4.0 Implementation Strategy

Define abstract repository classes in the domain layer. Implement these interfaces in the data layer, injecting data sources (e.g., FirebaseDataSource) that make the actual SDK calls. Use Riverpod to provide the concrete implementations to the rest of the app.

#### 4.1.1.5.0 Analysis Reasoning

This pattern is explicitly required by the architectural documentation and is essential for achieving the separation of concerns mandated by Clean Architecture (REQ-1-072) and supporting offline capabilities (REQ-1-009).

### 4.1.2.0.0 Pattern Name

#### 4.1.2.1.0 Pattern Name

Clean Architecture

#### 4.1.2.2.0 Pattern Application

This repository constitutes the 'Data Layer' within the Clean Architecture. It is an outer layer that depends on nothing inward (like the domain layer) and handles external dependencies (Firebase).

#### 4.1.2.3.0 Required Components

- Data Models (DTOs)
- Data Sources
- Repository Implementations

#### 4.1.2.4.0 Implementation Strategy

The repository will be organized into 'domain' and 'data' subdirectories. The 'data' directory will contain models, data sources, and repository implementations. The 'domain' layer (likely in a separate package) will only contain entities and repository interfaces.

#### 4.1.2.5.0 Analysis Reasoning

The system architecture is explicitly defined as Clean Architecture (REQ-1-072). This repository's structure and dependencies must strictly follow this pattern's dependency rule.

## 4.2.0.0.0 Integration Points

#### 5.1.1.1.0 Entity Name

AttendanceRecord

#### 5.1.1.2.0 Database Table

/tenants/{tenantId}/attendance/{attendanceRecordId}

#### 5.1.1.3.0 Required Properties

- userId, supervisorId, checkInTime, checkOutTime, status, eventId, flags[]

#### 5.1.1.4.0 Relationship Mappings

- Belongs to a User (via userId)
- Reviewed by a Supervisor (via supervisorId)

#### 5.1.1.5.0 Access Patterns

- Fetch by user for a date range.
- Fetch by supervisor where status is 'pending'.
- Fetch with filters for reporting (date, team, status).

#### 5.1.1.6.0 Analysis Reasoning

The 'AttendanceRecord' is the primary transactional entity. The repository must support its creation, updates (check-out, status changes), and various query patterns as seen in sequence diagrams (SEQ ID 267, 269, 281).

### 5.1.2.0.0 Entity Name

#### 5.1.2.1.0 Entity Name

User

#### 5.1.2.2.0 Database Table

# 6.0.0.0.0 Sequence Analysis

## 6.1.0.0.0 Interaction Patterns

### 6.1.1.0.0 Sequence Name

#### 6.1.1.1.0 Sequence Name

Offline Attendance Marking

#### 6.1.1.2.0 Repository Role

The repository receives the attendance data, checks for offline status, adds the 'isOfflineEntry' flag, and passes the data to the Firebase SDK for local caching.

#### 6.1.1.3.0 Required Interfaces

- IAttendanceRepository

#### 6.1.1.4.0 Method Specifications

- {'method_name': 'markAttendance', 'interaction_context': "Invoked by the application layer when a user taps 'Check-In' or 'Check-Out'.", 'parameter_analysis': "Receives GPS data, client timestamp, and a flag indicating if it's a check-in or check-out.", 'return_type_analysis': "Returns 'Future<void>' to indicate the operation has been accepted by the data layer (either sent or queued locally).", 'analysis_reasoning': 'This method encapsulates the core logic shown in sequence diagram SEQ ID 268, handling the creation of the record with the correct flags before persistence.'}

#### 6.1.1.5.0 Analysis Reasoning

Sequence ID 268 provides a detailed specification for the repository's role in the offline workflow. It confirms the repository must handle data construction before interacting with the SDK's persistence mechanism.

### 6.1.2.0.0 Sequence Name

#### 6.1.2.1.0 Sequence Name

Fetch Supervisor Approvals

#### 6.1.2.2.0 Repository Role

The repository receives a supervisor ID and constructs a Firestore query to listen for real-time updates to pending records.

#### 6.1.2.3.0 Required Interfaces

- IAttendanceRepository

#### 6.1.2.4.0 Method Specifications

- {'method_name': 'watchPendingApprovals', 'interaction_context': "Invoked by the Supervisor's dashboard view model to populate the approval list.", 'parameter_analysis': "Receives the 'supervisorId' of the currently logged-in user.", 'return_type_analysis': "Returns 'Stream<List<AttendanceRecord>>' which emits a new list of records whenever the underlying data changes in Firestore.", 'analysis_reasoning': 'This method implements the data fetching portion of sequence ID 269. Using a Stream is critical for the real-time UI updates required by the user stories (e.g., US-037).'}

#### 6.1.2.5.0 Analysis Reasoning

Sequence ID 269 shows the supervisor dashboard querying for pending records. The repository must provide a reactive stream to fulfill this requirement efficiently.

## 6.2.0.0.0 Communication Protocols

- {'protocol_type': 'gRPC (via Firestore SDK)', 'implementation_requirements': "The repository will use the standard 'cloud_firestore' Flutter package, which handles the gRPC communication protocol automatically.", 'analysis_reasoning': 'This is the default, highly optimized protocol used by the Firestore SDK for real-time data synchronization. The repository abstracts this detail away from the rest of the application.'}

# 7.0.0.0.0 Critical Analysis Findings

## 7.1.0.0.0 Finding Category

### 7.1.1.0.0 Finding Category

Architectural Keystone

### 7.1.2.0.0 Finding Description

This repository is the central point of abstraction between the application logic and the Firebase backend. Its design directly impacts the testability, maintainability, and offline capability of the entire client application.

### 7.1.3.0.0 Implementation Impact

Implementation must strictly adhere to the Repository and Clean Architecture patterns. Any deviation will compromise the architectural goals of the project.

### 7.1.4.0.0 Priority Level

High

### 7.1.5.0.0 Analysis Reasoning

The architecture documents (Clean Architecture, Repository Pattern) and multiple NFRs (Offline, Maintainability) all converge on the critical nature of this component.

## 7.2.0.0.0 Finding Category

### 7.2.1.0.0 Finding Category

Offline Logic

### 7.2.2.0.0 Finding Description

The repository itself does not manage the offline queue but is responsible for preparing data for offline storage. Specifically, it must add the 'isOfflineEntry: true' flag when offline, as specified in REQ-1-046.

### 7.2.3.0.0 Implementation Impact

A reliable connectivity check must be available to the repository implementations to determine when to add the flag. This logic is crucial for later auditing and reporting.

### 7.2.4.0.0 Priority Level

High

### 7.2.5.0.0 Analysis Reasoning

Sequence diagram SEQ ID 268 and requirement REQ-1-046 explicitly detail this responsibility, differentiating it from the SDK's automatic caching.

## 7.3.0.0.0 Finding Category

### 7.3.1.0.0 Finding Category

Data Modeling & Mapping

### 7.3.2.0.0 Finding Description

There must be a strict separation between pure Dart domain entities and Firebase-specific data models (DTOs) that handle 'fromFirestore' and 'toFirestore' logic.

### 7.3.3.0.0 Implementation Impact

Requires creating two sets of models and mappers between them. While this adds boilerplate, it is essential for persistence ignorance and fulfilling the Clean Architecture requirement (REQ-1-072).

### 7.3.4.0.0 Priority Level

Medium

### 7.3.5.0.0 Analysis Reasoning

The Clean Architecture pattern mandates this separation to protect the domain layer from external dependencies. The Firebase SDK's reliance on 'Map<String, dynamic>' makes this explicit mapping layer necessary.

# 8.0.0.0.0 Analysis Traceability

## 8.1.0.0.0 Cached Context Utilization

Analysis was performed by synthesizing data from the repository definition, mapped requirements (REQ-1-042, REQ-1-046), architectural patterns (Clean Architecture, Repository), database ER diagrams (ID: 54), and multiple sequence diagrams (ID: 267, 268, 269, 278, 281).

## 8.2.0.0.0 Analysis Decision Trail

- Identified repository as the Data Layer implementation of Clean Architecture.
- Mapped specific requirements to concrete method signatures (e.g., REQ-1-042 -> createAttendanceRecord).
- Analyzed sequence diagrams to confirm repository's role in offline (SEQ ID 268) and online (SEQ ID 267) workflows.
- Determined the necessity of separate DTOs and Domain Entities based on Clean Architecture principles and Firebase's data format.

## 8.3.0.0.0 Assumption Validations

- Validated that 'Repository Pattern' implies a strict interface/implementation separation, which is supported by Dart's abstract classes.
- Validated that offline support is to be handled by the Firebase SDK's built-in persistence, not a custom solution within this repository.

## 8.4.0.0.0 Cross Reference Checks

- Cross-referenced REQ-1-046 (offline flag) with SEQ ID 268 (offline sequence) to confirm the repository's responsibility.
- Cross-referenced Database Diagram ID 54 (entities) with various requirements to derive the necessary repository interfaces (Attendance, User, Event, etc.).
