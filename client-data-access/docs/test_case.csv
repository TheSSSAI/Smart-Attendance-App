"TEST-SEC-001","Multi-Tenancy Security","Security","Integration","Critical","true","High","Verify that a user from Tenant A cannot read, write, update, or delete any data belonging to Tenant B by directly calling the Firestore API, validating the enforcement of tenant isolation via Firestore Security Rules.","Critical - A failure here constitutes a complete data breach, violating core architectural principles (REQ-1-002, REQ-1-025) and leading to legal/financial ruin.","Medium","Two tenants (A and B) exist. User A is authenticated within Tenant A. A document exists in Tenant B.","1. Set up Firebase Emulator Suite with specific security rules. 2. Authenticate as User A (with tenantId 'A' custom claim). 3. Attempt a 'get' request on a document path in Tenant B (e.g., /tenants/B/users/someUser). 4. Attempt a 'create' request in Tenant B. 5. Attempt an 'update' request in Tenant B. 6.

App has location permissions.","1. Enable airplane mode on the device. 2. Launch the app and navigate to the attendance screen. 3. Tap 'Check-In'. 4.

Verify the 'pending sync' indicator disappears. 9. Verify the attendance record exists in the backend Firestore database with the 'isOfflineEntry' flag.","The offline attendance record is successfully captured, stored locally, and automatically synced to the server without user intervention, with the correct data and flags.","A test Subordinate user account.","Flutter `integration_test` framework; Physical device or emulator with network control.","6","24","8","Core check-in functionality (US-028), Firestore offline persistence must be enabled.","Staging environment connected to the Staging Firebase project.","100% of offline records are successfully synced within 60 seconds of network restoration and app launch.","High - Data loss, user frustration, loss of trust.","Every release candidate build.","Low","Delete test attendance records from the database after test run.","Locally stored data must be in the app's secure sandbox.","UI must remain responsive during offline operations.","The 'pending sync' indicator must have an accessible label for screen readers."
"TEST-FUNC-005","Admin Functionality","Functional","Integration","High","true","Medium","Verify the business rule that prevents an Admin from deactivating a Supervisor who has active subordinates (REQ-1-029).","Medium - Failure breaks the organizational hierarchy, orphaning users and breaking approval workflows.","Medium","Admin user is logged in. A Supervisor user exists with at least one active Subordinate reporting to them.","1. Authenticate as Admin user. 2. Call the 'deactivateUser' Cloud Function with the Supervisor's ID. 3. Verify the function returns a specific error code (e.g., 'failed-precondition'). 4. Query Firestore to confirm the Supervisor's status remains 'active'. 5. Call the function again for a Supervisor with NO active subordinates. 6. Verify the function returns success and the Supervisor's status is 'deactivated'.","The deactivation call must fail for supervisors with active reports, returning a specific error.

The database is seeded with a large volume of data.","1. Seed the Firestore database with 1,000 users and 3 months of attendance data (~90,000 records). 2. Configure a load test script to simulate 50 concurrent Admins requesting the monthly summary report. 3. Execute the load test for 10 minutes. 4. Monitor the p95 response time of the reporting Cloud Function/API. 5. Monitor Firestore read op counts.","The p95 response time for the report generation must remain under 3 seconds. Firestore read ops should be proportional to the number of summary documents, not raw attendance records.","Large, realistic dataset for users and attendance.
