"Backend Bottleneck Mitigation","Senior backend developer is over-allocated by >95% in early sprints, creating a critical bottleneck.","Augment team with one senior backend Firebase contractor for the first 12 weeks of the project.","Reduces timeline by an estimated 8 weeks. Lowers risk of burnout and quality issues. Allows for parallel development of Onboarding and Reporting epics.","40000","2 weeks to onboard","Sprint velocity increases by 30%. Critical backend tasks are completed on or ahead of schedule.","Reduced time-to-market and mitigation of high-impact delay risks."
"Cross-training & Skill Redundancy","Limited skill overlap between specialized frontend, mobile, and backend roles.","Dedicate 4 hours per sprint for formal pair programming sessions: backend.dev with fullstack.dev on security rules; frontend.dev with mobile.dev on complex state management.","Reduces key person dependency risk by 40%. Improves code quality and consistency across platforms.","","Ongoing","At least two developers are confident in reviewing and making minor changes to each critical component (Security Rules, State Management, CI/CD).","Increased team resilience and reduced risk of project stalls due to resource unavailability."
