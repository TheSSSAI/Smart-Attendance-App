"RISK-001","Technical","A flaw in the complex Firestore Security Rules for multi-tenancy and Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) could lead to a catastrophic data breach, allowing users from one tenant to access data from another or escalate their privileges within their own tenant.","5","5","25","Critical","All data access operations (read/write) across the entire application. Specifically affects REQ-1-002, REQ-1-025, REQ-1-068.","The entire data segregation and security model relies on a complex, declarative ruleset that is difficult to debug and where small errors can have massive consequences. Any change to the data model or roles requires updating these rules perfectly.","1. Implement a comprehensive security rule test suite using the Firebase Emulator Suite. 2. Mandate that every Pull Request modifying `firestore.rules` must include corresponding test cases. 3. Enforce a strict peer review process for all security rule changes, requiring sign-off from the Lead Backend Developer.","Maintain a 'lockdown' version of `firestore.rules` that denies all read/write access. In case of a detected breach, this ruleset can be deployed immediately to halt all data access while the vulnerability is patched.","CI/CD pipeline fails due to a security rule test failure. Post-deployment, an alert from Google Cloud Monitoring on anomalous 'DENY' rates in Firestore audit logs.","Lead Backend Developer","2025-02-15","Not Started"
"RISK-002","Technical","Improper handling, storage, or exchange of OAuth 2.0 tokens for the Google Sheets integration (REQ-1-008, REQ-1-058) could lead to a severe security vulnerability, potentially exposing a user's entire Google Drive/Sheets to unauthorized access.","3","5","15","High","Work items WI-005-02-002, WI-005-02-003, WI-005-02-004. Directly impacts US-066.","OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code Flow is complex and involves multiple steps and sensitive credentials (client secret, refresh tokens). Storing refresh tokens insecurely or exposing the client secret on the frontend are common but critical implementation errors.","1. Strictly enforce server-side token exchange in a secure Cloud Function. 2. Store the OAuth client secret and all user refresh tokens in Google Secret Manager, not in Firestore or source code (REQ-1-069). 3. Grant the Cloud Function minimal IAM permissions to access only the required secrets.","If a token leak is suspected, immediately revoke the compromised credentials via the Google Cloud Console and trigger a forced re-authentication for all users of the integration. Implement a function to programmatically revoke tokens.","Google Cloud audit logs show unexpected API calls from the service account. High rate of token refresh failures in Cloud Function logs.","Lead Backend Developer","2025-03-30","Not Started"
"RISK-003","Technical","The custom logic for tracking and notifying users of offline attendance records that have failed to sync for over 24 hours (REQ-1-009) may fail, leading to silent data loss for users with persistent connectivity issues, eroding trust and data integrity.","3","4","12","Medium","Work items WI-003-01-003 and WI-003-01-004. Directly impacts US-033, US-034, US-035.","Firestore's built-in offline cache does not expose timestamps for pending writes, requiring a complex and potentially fragile custom solution to track the age of unsynced records, which may not be resilient to app crashes or OS background process limitations.","1. Implement a robust auxiliary tracking mechanism using a lightweight local database (e.g., Drift/sqlite) to store metadata (record ID, creation timestamp) for pending writes. 2. Implement comprehensive E2E tests that simulate prolonged offline states and verify the notification logic.","If data loss is reported, provide Admins with a tool for manual entry of missed attendance. Implement remote logging from the client-side sync service to diagnose failures.","Increase in user support tickets related to 'missing' attendance records. Remote logs show errors in the client-side sync service.","Lead Mobile Developer","2025-04-15","Not Started"
"RISK-004","Technical","Failing to design for scalability in reporting queries can lead to severe performance degradation and exorbitant Firestore read costs as tenants grow, making the reporting features unusable and financially unsustainable.","4","4","16","High","Work Stream WS-004-02 (Reporting Module), especially WI-004-02-002 (Attendance Summary Report). Impacts US-059.","Performing complex aggregations and filtering on large datasets on the client-side is inefficient. Naive Firestore queries without proper indexing or server-side pre-aggregation will not scale.","1. Mandate the use of server-side aggregation via scheduled Cloud Functions to pre-calculate daily/monthly summaries and store them in a separate reporting collection. 2. All reporting queries must be analyzed for performance and require corresponding composite indexes defined in `firestore.indexes.json`.","If performance degrades, temporarily disable complex filters in the UI. Implement an emergency Cloud Function to perform a one-time data backfill into a new, optimized reporting collection.","GCP Budget alerts are triggered, with Firestore Read Ops as the primary cost driver. Cloud Monitoring shows p95 latency for reporting API calls exceeding 2000ms.","Lead Backend Developer","2025-03-01","Not Started"
"RISK-005","Technical","A bug in the automated, scheduled Cloud Function for permanent tenant data deletion (REQ-1-035) could lead to catastrophic, irreversible data loss for the wrong tenant or incomplete deletion, resulting in a compliance failure.","2","5","10","Medium","Work item WI-002-03-003 (Implement Scheduled Permanent Data Deletion).","The destructive and irreversible nature of the task means any logical error, such as a faulty query for expired tenants, has extreme consequences. The complexity of recursively deleting all sub-collections for a tenant is high.","1. Implement a 'dry run' mode for the function that logs what it *would* delete without actually deleting anything. 2. The function must be tested extensively in an isolated test environment with mock data. 3. The query for expired tenants must be wrapped in a transaction to re-verify the tenant's status before deletion to prevent race conditions.","Restore the affected tenant's data from the last daily backup (accepting up to 24 hours of data loss as per RPO). Immediately disable the scheduled deletion function pending a full investigation.","Cloud Monitoring alert for an unusually high number of Firestore deletes. High error rate for the deletion function itself.","DevOps Lead","2025-05-01","Not Started"
"RISK-006","Resource","The project's success is highly dependent on developers with specialized, cross-domain expertise in Flutter (including web), advanced Firestore (complex rules, indexing), and TypeScript Cloud Functions. A skill gap in any of these areas can lead to poor architecture, security flaws, and project delays.","3","4","12","Medium","All development work items, particularly complex ones like WI-002-01-001 (Security Rules) and WI-005-02-002 (OAuth Flow).","The mandated technology stack is modern and powerful but requires deep knowledge. Finding developers who are expert in all layers (client, backend, security rules) is challenging, creating key-person dependencies.","1. Enforce a mandatory peer review process for all critical code, especially `firestore.rules` and security-sensitive Cloud Functions. 2. Promote knowledge sharing through pair programming sessions on complex features. 3. Invest in targeted training for the team on advanced Firestore features.","Engage an external Firebase/GCP consultant for architectural reviews at key project milestones. Allocate budget for emergency external support if a critical skill gap blocks progress.","Repeated regressions in a specific area of the codebase. Consistently missed estimates for tasks in a particular technology (e.g., Firestore Rules).","Project Manager","2025-02-01","In Progress"
"RISK-007","External","The project is tightly coupled to external Google APIs (Maps, Sheets) and SendGrid. Unexpected API changes, pricing increases, or service outages could break core functionality, halt development, and significantly increase operational costs.","3","4","12","Medium","All work items in Work Stream WS-005-02 (Google Services Integration) and WI-002-02-002 (User Invitation).","The serverless architecture relies heavily on third-party managed services, trading control for development speed. This makes the project vulnerable to external dependencies' stability, policies, and pricing models.","1. Implement robust error handling, logging, and alerting for all external API calls. 2. Create an abstraction layer (repository pattern) for external services to simplify replacement if necessary. 3. Closely monitor API usage against free tier limits and configure budget alerts.","For each integration, have a documented plan to disable the feature gracefully in the UI if the external service fails. For Sheets, this means queuing data for later export. For Maps, this means hiding the map view.","Alerts from Cloud Monitoring on high error rates for API calls to external services. Notifications from vendors about upcoming API changes or pricing updates.","Lead Backend Developer","2025-03-15","Not Started"
"RISK-008","Quality","Failure to consistently implement and test against WCAG 2.1 Level AA accessibility standards (REQ-1-063, REQ-1-059) from the start will result in significant and costly refactoring late in the project, potential legal compliance issues, and a product that is unusable for a segment of the population.","4","3","12","Medium","All UI-related work items for both the mobile and web applications, such as US-078 and US-079.","Accessibility is often treated as an afterthought rather than a core development requirement. Without dedicated testing and developer awareness, it is easily overlooked, accumulating significant technical debt.","1. Integrate automated accessibility checks (e.g., contrast ratio, tap target size) into the CI pipeline. 2. Make accessibility review a mandatory part of the Pull Request checklist for all UI changes. 3. Conduct regular manual testing with screen readers (VoiceOver, TalkBack) on physical devices.","If significant accessibility gaps are found late in the cycle, prioritize fixing them in a dedicated 'hardening' sprint before release. Allocate budget for a third-party accessibility audit.","Automated accessibility checks in the CI pipeline fail. Negative feedback from User Acceptance Testing (UAT) regarding usability with assistive technologies.","QA Lead","2025-02-28","Not Started"
"RISK-009","Technical","The architectural complexity of implementing true data residency (REQ-1-024) is high. A misconfiguration could lead to a major compliance breach by storing tenant data in the incorrect geographic region, resulting in legal and financial penalties.","3","5","15","High","Work item US-003. This is a foundational architectural decision affecting the entire backend.","Achieving data residency in a serverless environment like Firebase can be complex, potentially requiring a project-per-region model or careful management of multi-region Firestore instances, which adds significant operational overhead and complexity.","1. Conduct a mandatory architectural design review and create a proof-of-concept (PoC) for the chosen multi-region strategy before full implementation. 2. Automate the provisioning of new regional infrastructure using scripts to ensure consistency. 3. Implement strict IAM policies to prevent accidental cross-region data access.","If a data residency breach is discovered, immediately execute a documented incident response plan, including legal counsel engagement and customer notification. Begin an emergency data migration process to the correct region.","Regular manual audits of data location in the GCP console during the QA phase for test tenants. Review of Cloud Audit Logs for any cross-region service calls.","Chief Architect / DevOps Lead","2025-02-20","Not Started"
"RISK-010","Timeline","Underestimation of the time required for comprehensive end-to-end (E2E) testing, especially for complex, multi-platform features like offline sync, OAuth flows, and multi-step user onboarding, could lead to a rushed testing phase, poor quality, and delayed release.","4","3","12","Medium","Affects the overall project timeline and quality of all major epics, particularly EPIC-002, EPIC-003, and EPIC-005.","The project contains numerous features that are difficult to test with unit tests alone (e.g., network transitions, native permission dialogs, third-party redirects), requiring significant manual and automated E2E testing effort which is often not fully accounted for.","1. For each complex feature, create a detailed E2E test plan during the design phase. 2. Allocate at least 25% of the development time for a feature to its testing and QA. 3. Automate E2E test cases using Flutter's `integration_test` framework wherever possible to reduce the manual testing burden.","If testing reveals major issues late in the cycle, descope non-critical features from the release to allow more time for stabilizing the core product. Re-negotiate the release timeline with stakeholders based on testing feedback.","The bug discovery rate increases sharply during the final weeks of a release cycle. Key E2E test cases are consistently failing.","QA Lead","2025-02-15","In Progress"
