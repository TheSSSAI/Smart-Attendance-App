This entity relationship diagram illustrates the structure for a time-series measurement named 'AttendanceMeasurement'. In a time-series model like InfluxDB, this single measurement captures all attendance events. The 'time' attribute is the primary key and the main index. Other attributes are classified as either 'tags' (tenantId, userId, etc.) for efficient filtering and grouping, or 'fields' (latitude, longitude, etc.) which represent the actual data points recorded at that specific time. There are no relationships as this is a denormalized structure optimized for fast ingestion and time-based queries.
