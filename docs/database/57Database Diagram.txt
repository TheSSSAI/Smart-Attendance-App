This diagram illustrates a key-value store design for caching tenant configurations. The 'TenantConfigurationCache' represents the cache structure where each record consists of a unique key, formatted as 'config:tenant:{tenantId}', and a corresponding value which is the serialized tenant configuration object in JSON format. This model is optimized for rapid data retrieval, typical for in-memory databases like Redis, by using a direct key lookup.
