This ER diagram visualizes a graph database schema designed for managing organizational hierarchies. 'User' and 'Team' nodes are represented as entities with their primary keys. The relationships (edges) are shown with cardinality: 'REPORTS_TO' is a recursive one-to-many relationship on User, 'MEMBER_OF' is a many-to-many relationship between User and Team, and 'SUPERVISES' is a one-to-many relationship from a User to a Team.
