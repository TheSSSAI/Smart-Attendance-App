This diagram illustrates the complete data model for the attendance tracking system. It includes core entities like Tenant, User, and AttendanceRecord, along with supporting entities for team management, event scheduling, auditing, and configuration. Key relationships such as the user hierarchy, tenant data isolation, and many-to-many mappings for team memberships and event assignments are depicted. The model is designed for multi-tenancy, with tenantId serving as a primary data isolation key across most tables.
