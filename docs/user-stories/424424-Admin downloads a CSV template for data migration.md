# 3 Acceptance Criteria

## 3.1 Criteria Id

### 3.1.1 Criteria Id

AC-001

### 3.1.2 Scenario

Admin successfully downloads the CSV template

### 3.1.3 Scenario Type

Happy_Path

### 3.1.4 Given

I am an Admin logged into the web dashboard and have navigated to the 'User Management > Data Import' section

### 3.1.5 When

I click the 'Download CSV Template' button

### 3.1.6 Then

my browser initiates a download of a file named 'user_team_import_template.csv'

### 3.1.7 Validation Notes

Verify that the file download is triggered and the filename is correct.

## 3.2.0 Criteria Id

### 3.2.1 Criteria Id

AC-002

### 3.2.2 Scenario

Downloaded template has the correct headers

### 3.2.3 Scenario Type

Happy_Path

### 3.2.4 Given

I have successfully downloaded the 'user_team_import_template.csv' file

### 3.2.5 When

I open the file in a spreadsheet application

### 3.2.6 Then

the first row must contain the exact headers in this order: 'email', 'firstName', 'lastName', 'role', 'supervisorEmail', 'teamName'

### 3.2.7 Validation Notes

Manually inspect the downloaded CSV file to confirm the header row's content and order. The validation script for the upload feature (US-083) will depend on this exact structure.

## 3.3.0 Criteria Id

### 3.3.1 Criteria Id

AC-003

### 3.3.2 Scenario

Downloaded template contains example data

### 3.3.3 Scenario Type

Happy_Path

### 3.3.4 Given

I have successfully downloaded the 'user_team_import_template.csv' file

### 3.3.5 When

I open the file

### 3.3.6 Then

the file contains at least one commented-out or actual example row demonstrating the expected data format for a Supervisor and a Subordinate (e.g., '#jane.doe@example.com,Jane,Doe,Supervisor,,Executive Team' and '#john.smith@example.com,John,Smith,Subordinate,jane.doe@example.com,Executive Team')

### 3.3.7 Validation Notes

Inspect the file content to ensure clear examples are provided to guide the user.

## 3.4.0 Criteria Id

### 3.4.1 Criteria Id

AC-004

### 3.4.2 Scenario

Non-Admin users cannot access the download functionality

### 3.4.3 Scenario Type

Error_Condition

### 3.4.4 Given

I am logged in as a 'Supervisor' or 'Subordinate'

### 3.4.5 When

I navigate through the application

### 3.4.6 Then

I must not see the 'Data Import' section or any button/link to download the CSV template

### 3.4.7 Validation Notes

Log in with test accounts for each role (Supervisor, Subordinate) and confirm the UI element is not present. Attempting to access the download URL directly should result in a '403 Forbidden' error.

## 3.5.0 Criteria Id

### 3.5.1 Criteria Id

AC-005

### 3.5.2 Scenario

System handles missing template file gracefully

### 3.5.3 Scenario Type

Edge_Case

### 3.5.4 Given

I am an Admin on the 'Data Import' page

### 3.5.5 And

the template file is unavailable on the server for any reason

### 3.5.6 When

I click the 'Download CSV Template' button

### 3.5.7 Then

a user-friendly error message is displayed, such as 'Template file could not be downloaded. Please try again later or contact support.'

### 3.5.8 Validation Notes

This can be tested by temporarily renaming or deleting the template file in the staging environment's storage.

# 4.0.0 User Interface Requirements

## 4.1.0 Ui Elements

- A clearly labeled button or link, e.g., 'Download CSV Template'.

## 4.2.0 User Interactions

- Clicking the button/link should immediately trigger a file download in the browser.

## 4.3.0 Display Requirements

- The button/link should be located in a logical place within the Admin web dashboard, such as a 'User Management' or dedicated 'Data Import' section.
- Brief instructional text should be present near the button, explaining its purpose (e.g., 'Use this template to format your user and team data for bulk import.').

## 4.4.0 Accessibility Needs

- The download button/link must be keyboard accessible (focusable and activatable with Enter/Space).
- It must have appropriate ARIA attributes and meet WCAG 2.1 AA color contrast standards, as per REQ-INT-001.

# 5.0.0 Business Rules

- {'rule_id': 'BR-001', 'rule_description': "Only users with the 'Admin' role can access the data import functionality, including the template download.", 'enforcement_point': 'Both client-side (UI visibility) and server-side (endpoint authorization).', 'violation_handling': 'UI element is hidden for unauthorized roles. Direct API calls from unauthorized users are rejected with a 403 Forbidden status.'}

# 6.0.0 Dependencies

## 6.1.0 Prerequisite Stories

### 6.1.1 Story Id

#### 6.1.1.1 Story Id

US-001

#### 6.1.1.2 Dependency Reason

An Admin user and tenant must exist to access the Admin dashboard.

### 6.1.2.0 Story Id

#### 6.1.2.1 Story Id

US-021

#### 6.1.2.2 Dependency Reason

The Admin web dashboard must exist as a location for the download functionality.

## 6.2.0.0 Technical Dependencies

- Firebase Authentication for role-based access control.
- Firebase Hosting for the Flutter web dashboard.
- Firebase Storage or a static asset pipeline to host the CSV file.

## 6.3.0.0 Data Dependencies

- The CSV column structure must be finalized and aligned with the data model (REQ-DAT-001) and the import logic of US-083.

## 6.4.0.0 External Dependencies

*No items available*

# 7.0.0.0 Non Functional Requirements

## 7.1.0.0 Performance

- The file download should initiate in under 1 second after the user's click, as it is a small, static file.

## 7.2.0.0 Security

- The endpoint serving the file must be protected and require an authenticated session from a user with the 'Admin' role.
- The template file itself must not contain any sensitive or tenant-specific data.

## 7.3.0.0 Usability

- The purpose of the template and the download link should be immediately obvious to the Admin user.

## 7.4.0.0 Accessibility

- Must comply with WCAG 2.1 Level AA standards as per REQ-INT-001.

## 7.5.0.0 Compatibility

- The download functionality must work on all supported browsers for the web dashboard (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge) as per REQ-DEP-001.

# 8.0.0.0 Implementation Considerations

## 8.1.0.0 Complexity Assessment

Low

## 8.2.0.0 Complexity Factors

- Requires a simple UI addition to the Flutter web app.
- The CSV file is static and can be bundled as an asset or stored in Firebase Storage.
- If stored in Storage, a simple Cloud Function may be needed to serve a secure, authenticated download link.

## 8.3.0.0 Technical Risks

- Minor risk of mismatch between the template format defined in this story and the format expected by the import logic in US-083. Close coordination is required.

## 8.4.0.0 Integration Points

- This feature is the primary input for the data import feature (US-083).

# 9.0.0.0 Testing Requirements

## 9.1.0.0 Testing Types

- Unit
- Integration
- E2E
- Security

## 9.2.0.0 Test Scenarios

- Admin successfully downloads the template and verifies its content.
- Supervisor attempts to access the download functionality and is denied.
- Subordinate attempts to access the download functionality and is denied.
- Verify file content (headers, examples) is exactly as specified.

## 9.3.0.0 Test Data Needs

- Test user accounts with 'Admin', 'Supervisor', and 'Subordinate' roles.

## 9.4.0.0 Testing Tools

- Flutter Test framework for widget tests.
- Firebase Local Emulator Suite for local integration testing.

# 10.0.0.0 Definition Of Done

- All acceptance criteria validated and passing
- Code reviewed and approved by team
- Unit tests implemented and passing for any new logic
- Integration testing completed successfully in a staging environment
- User interface reviewed and approved by the Product Owner

# 11.0.0.0 Planning Information

## 11.1.0.0 Story Points

1

## 11.2.0.0 Priority

- This story is a hard dependency for US-083 (CSV Upload). It must be completed before or in the same sprint as US-083 begins.

## 11.4.0.0 Release Impact

This is a key enabling feature for the data migration capability, which is critical for onboarding new organizations.
