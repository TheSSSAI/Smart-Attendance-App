# 3 Acceptance Criteria

## 3.1 Criteria Id

### 3.1.1 Criteria Id

AC-001

### 3.1.2 Scenario

Admin receives an alert when a usage metric reaches the first threshold (80%)

### 3.1.3 Scenario Type

Happy_Path

### 3.1.4 Given

An organization is on a subscription tier with a defined limit of 100,000 Firestore reads for the current billing cycle, and an alert threshold is set at 80%.

### 3.1.5 When

The organization's aggregated Firestore read count for the cycle reaches 80,000.

### 3.1.6 Then

An email notification is sent to all users with the 'Admin' role for that tenant.

### 3.1.7 And

The email and banner content clearly state that 'Firestore reads' usage has reached 80% of the monthly limit.

### 3.1.8 Validation Notes

Verify by checking the Admin's email inbox and by logging into the web dashboard as the Admin. The alert state should be recorded in Firestore to prevent duplicate alerts for this threshold.

## 3.2.0 Criteria Id

### 3.2.1 Criteria Id

AC-002

### 3.2.2 Scenario

Admin receives a second, distinct alert for the next threshold (95%)

### 3.2.3 Scenario Type

Happy_Path

### 3.2.4 Given

An organization has already received an 80% usage alert for Firestore reads.

### 3.2.5 When

The organization's aggregated Firestore read count for the cycle reaches 95,000 (the 95% threshold).

### 3.2.6 Then

A new, distinct email notification is sent to all Admins.

### 3.2.7 And

The notification banner on the Admin web dashboard updates to reflect the 95% usage level.

### 3.2.8 Validation Notes

Ensure a new alert is triggered and the UI updates, rather than the system ignoring the event because a previous alert was sent.

## 3.3.0 Criteria Id

### 3.3.1 Criteria Id

AC-003

### 3.3.2 Scenario

Alerts are sent to all Admins of a tenant

### 3.3.3 Scenario Type

Edge_Case

### 3.3.4 Given

A tenant has three users with the 'Admin' role.

### 3.3.5 When

A usage threshold is crossed for that tenant.

### 3.3.6 Then

All three Admins receive the identical email notification.

### 3.3.7 And

All three Admins see the notification banner when they log into their dashboards.

### 3.3.8 Validation Notes

Requires a test tenant setup with multiple Admins to verify broadcast delivery.

## 3.4.0 Criteria Id

### 3.4.1 Criteria Id

AC-004

### 3.4.2 Scenario

Usage alerts are cleared at the start of a new billing cycle

### 3.4.3 Scenario Type

Alternative_Flow

### 3.4.4 Given

An Admin's dashboard is displaying a 95% usage alert banner.

### 3.4.5 When

The system date rolls over to the first day of the new billing cycle.

### 3.4.6 Then

The usage alert banner is automatically removed from the Admin's dashboard.

### 3.4.7 And

The system is ready to send new alerts for the new cycle once thresholds are met again.

### 3.4.8 Validation Notes

Test by manually triggering the billing cycle reset logic and verifying the alert state is cleared in Firestore and the UI updates on refresh.

## 3.5.0 Criteria Id

### 3.5.1 Criteria Id

AC-005

### 3.5.2 Scenario

Alerts are re-evaluated after a plan upgrade

### 3.5.3 Scenario Type

Alternative_Flow

### 3.5.4 Given

A tenant on a 'Free' plan (100k reads) has a usage of 85,000 reads and an active 80% alert.

### 3.5.5 When

An Admin upgrades the tenant to a 'Pro' plan with a 500,000 read limit.

### 3.5.6 Then

The alert banner is immediately removed from the dashboard, as 85,000 is now well below the new 80% threshold (400,000).

### 3.5.7 Validation Notes

Test the upgrade workflow and verify that the alert-checking logic is re-triggered or that the UI component correctly re-evaluates the condition.

## 3.6.0 Criteria Id

### 3.6.1 Criteria Id

AC-006

### 3.6.2 Scenario

System handles email delivery failures gracefully

### 3.6.3 Scenario Type

Error_Condition

### 3.6.4 Given

An Admin's registered email address is invalid or bounces.

### 3.6.5 When

The system attempts to send a usage alert email.

### 3.6.6 Then

The email delivery failure is logged by the system (e.g., via SendGrid webhook).

### 3.6.7 And

The failure does not prevent the dashboard banner from being displayed or emails from being sent to other valid Admins.

### 3.6.8 Validation Notes

Use a known bad email address in testing and check server logs for the delivery failure.

# 4.0.0 User Interface Requirements

## 4.1.0 Ui Elements

- A persistent notification banner at the top of the Admin web dashboard.

## 4.2.0 User Interactions

- The banner is not dismissible by the user.
- The banner may contain a link to the 'Subscription' or 'Billing' page.

## 4.3.0 Display Requirements

- Banner text must clearly state the resource (e.g., 'Data Storage', 'Firestore Reads') and the usage percentage reached (e.g., '80%').
- Banner should have a warning-level color (e.g., yellow/amber).

## 4.4.0 Accessibility Needs

- The banner must use an appropriate ARIA role (e.g., `role="alert"`) to be announced by screen readers.
- Text and background colors must meet WCAG 2.1 AA contrast ratio standards.

# 5.0.0 Business Rules

## 5.1.0 Rule Id

### 5.1.1 Rule Id

BR-001

### 5.1.2 Rule Description

Usage alert thresholds are defined system-wide per subscription tier and are not user-configurable.

### 5.1.3 Enforcement Point

Backend Cloud Function during usage check.

### 5.1.4 Violation Handling

N/A - System configuration.

## 5.2.0 Rule Id

### 5.2.1 Rule Id

BR-002

### 5.2.2 Rule Description

A specific alert (e.g., Firestore reads at 80%) will only be sent once per tenant per billing cycle to prevent spam.

### 5.2.3 Enforcement Point

Backend Cloud Function checks for a pre-existing alert flag before sending a new notification.

### 5.2.4 Violation Handling

The function logs that the condition is met but skips sending the notification.

# 6.0.0 Dependencies

## 6.1.0 Prerequisite Stories

### 6.1.1 Story Id

#### 6.1.1.1 Story Id

US-001

#### 6.1.1.2 Dependency Reason

Requires the existence of tenants to associate usage with.

### 6.1.2.0 Story Id

#### 6.1.2.1 Story Id

N/A - Subscription Tiers

#### 6.1.2.2 Dependency Reason

Requires a defined system of subscription tiers with specific, machine-readable usage limits (e.g., Firestore reads, function invocations) to compare against.

## 6.2.0.0 Technical Dependencies

- A reliable mechanism for aggregating per-tenant resource usage. This likely involves setting up GCP Billing export to BigQuery.
- A scheduled Cloud Function to periodically process the aggregated usage data.
- Configured SendGrid integration (or other email provider) for sending email alerts.

## 6.3.0.0 Data Dependencies

- Access to subscription tier limit data.
- Access to aggregated tenant usage data from the billing pipeline.

## 6.4.0.0 External Dependencies

- Google Cloud Billing API/Export service for providing usage data.

# 7.0.0.0 Non Functional Requirements

## 7.1.0.0 Performance

- The usage aggregation and checking process must not introduce noticeable performance degradation to the core application.
- The scheduled function should complete its run for all tenants within a reasonable timeframe (e.g., under 5 minutes).

## 7.2.0.0 Security

- Usage data and alerts must be strictly segregated by tenant. There must be no possibility of one tenant seeing another's usage information.
- The process for querying billing data must use service accounts with the principle of least privilege.

## 7.3.0.0 Usability

- Alert messages (email and dashboard) must be clear, concise, and easily understandable by a non-technical Admin.
- Alerts should be actionable, guiding the user on what they can do next (e.g., 'Consider upgrading your plan').

## 7.4.0.0 Accessibility

- All UI elements related to this feature must meet WCAG 2.1 Level AA standards.

## 7.5.0.0 Compatibility

- The dashboard banner must render correctly on all supported browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).

# 8.0.0.0 Implementation Considerations

## 8.1.0.0 Complexity Assessment

High

## 8.2.0.0 Complexity Factors

- Setting up and managing the data pipeline from GCP Billing to BigQuery is a significant infrastructure task.
- Developing the logic to accurately parse and attribute project-wide usage from BigQuery to specific tenants within the application is complex.
- The process is asynchronous and batched, not real-time, which adds complexity to testing and state management.
- Requires robust error handling for the entire data pipeline.

## 8.3.0.0 Technical Risks

- Delays or inaccuracies in the GCP Billing data export could lead to late or incorrect alerts.
- The query to attribute costs to tenants could be complex and costly to run if not optimized.
- Changes in Firebase/GCP billing metrics could break the parsing logic.

## 8.4.0.0 Integration Points

- Google Cloud Billing Export / BigQuery
- Firebase Firestore (for storing alert state and tier configs)
- Firebase Cloud Functions (for scheduled job)
- SendGrid API (for emails)
- Admin Web Dashboard (for UI banner)

# 9.0.0.0 Testing Requirements

## 9.1.0.0 Testing Types

- Unit
- Integration
- E2E

## 9.2.0.0 Test Scenarios

- Verify alert logic against a mock BigQuery dataset with various usage levels.
- Test the full integration flow: mock data -> scheduled function trigger -> Firestore state update -> email dispatch -> UI update.
- End-to-end test where a test Admin logs in and confirms the banner is visible based on pre-seeded alert data.

## 9.3.0.0 Test Data Needs

- A sample BigQuery table populated with usage data for multiple test tenants.
- Test tenants configured on different subscription tiers.
- Test user accounts with Admin roles and valid/invalid email addresses.

## 9.4.0.0 Testing Tools

- Firebase Local Emulator Suite
- Jest for Cloud Function unit tests
- A tool for manually triggering scheduled Cloud Functions during tests.

# 10.0.0.0 Definition Of Done

# 11.0.0.0 Planning Information

## 11.1.0.0 Story Points

13

## 11.2.0.0 Priority

🔴 High

## 11.3.0.0 Sprint Considerations

- This is a large, backend-heavy story. It may need to be broken into smaller technical tasks (e.g., 'Setup BigQuery Export', 'Develop Usage Check Function', 'Implement UI Banner').
- Requires a developer with experience in GCP infrastructure, BigQuery, and Cloud Functions.
- The infrastructure setup (BigQuery export) should be started as early as possible as it can have a lead time.

## 11.4.0.0 Release Impact

This is a key feature for commercial viability and customer retention for paid tiers. It should be included in any release targeting business customers.
