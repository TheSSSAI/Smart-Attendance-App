# 4.0.0 User Interface Requirements

## 4.1.0 Ui Elements

- A mandatory dropdown menu labeled 'Data Residency Region' on the organization registration form.
- Helper text below the dropdown: 'Choose the geographic region where your organization's data will be stored. This selection is permanent and cannot be changed later.'
- Validation error message display area for the dropdown.

## 4.2.0 User Interactions

- The dropdown must be populated with a list of user-friendly region names (e.g., 'United States (Central)', 'Europe (Belgium)').
- Selecting a region is required to enable the final registration submission button.

## 4.3.0 Display Requirements

- The list of regions must be fetched from a centralized configuration source to ensure consistency.
- The selected region must be displayed in a read-only format within the Admin's organization settings after registration.

## 4.4.0 Accessibility Needs

- The dropdown and its label must be compliant with WCAG 2.1 AA standards, including proper labeling for screen readers.

# 5.0.0 Business Rules

## 5.1.0 Rule Id

### 5.1.1 Rule Id

BR-001

### 5.1.2 Rule Description

The data residency region for a tenant is immutable and cannot be changed after the tenant has been created.

### 5.1.3 Enforcement Point

Backend API and Frontend UI. The backend must not allow updates to this field, and the UI must not present an option to edit it.

### 5.1.4 Violation Handling

API requests attempting to modify the `dataResidencyRegion` field post-creation will be rejected with a `403 Forbidden` error.

## 5.2.0 Rule Id

### 5.2.1 Rule Id

BR-002

### 5.2.2 Rule Description

Only predefined and supported GCP regions can be selected for data residency.

### 5.2.3 Enforcement Point

Backend tenant creation Cloud Function.

### 5.2.4 Violation Handling

If an invalid region is submitted, the tenant creation process fails, and an error is logged.

# 6.0.0 Dependencies

## 6.1.0 Prerequisite Stories

- {'story_id': 'US-001', 'dependency_reason': 'This story adds a mandatory field to the tenant registration flow established in US-001. The basic registration functionality must exist first.'}

## 6.2.0 Technical Dependencies

- A confirmed and implemented architectural strategy for multi-region data storage using Firebase/GCP. This may involve a project-per-region model or multiple Firestore databases within a single project.
- A backend configuration service or file to manage the list of available regions and their mappings (e.g., 'Europe (Frankfurt)' -> 'europe-west3').
- The tenant creation Cloud Function must be capable of provisioning resources and storing data in the specified region.

## 6.3.0 Data Dependencies

*No items available*

## 6.4.0 External Dependencies

- Availability of Firestore service in the desired Google Cloud Platform regions.

# 7.0.0 Non Functional Requirements

## 7.1.0 Performance

- The list of available regions should load on the registration page in under 500ms.

## 7.2.0 Security

- The selected region must be validated on the server-side to prevent client-side manipulation of the submitted value.
- All data for the tenant, both at rest and in transit, must remain within the selected geographic region's boundaries as defined by GCP.

## 7.3.0 Usability

- The purpose and permanence of the region selection must be clearly communicated to the user via helper text.

## 7.4.0 Accessibility

- The UI component must meet WCAG 2.1 Level AA standards.

## 7.5.0 Compatibility

- The registration form, including this new field, must function correctly on all supported web browsers as defined in REQ-DEP-001.

# 8.0.0 Implementation Considerations

## 8.1.0 Complexity Assessment

High

## 8.2.0 Complexity Factors

- Significant architectural dependency on a multi-region infrastructure setup, which is complex to design and implement correctly.
- Requires robust backend logic to route all future data operations for a tenant to the correct regional database.
- Potential need for a routing layer or dynamic client configuration to connect to the correct regional endpoint.
- Testing requires infrastructure access to verify data is physically stored in the correct location.

## 8.3.0 Technical Risks

- The primary risk is underestimating the architectural complexity of true data residency. A misconfiguration could lead to data being stored in the wrong region, causing a major compliance breach.
- A preliminary technical spike is highly recommended to validate the chosen multi-region architecture before committing to implementation.

## 8.4.0 Integration Points

- Firebase Authentication (for user creation).
- Firebase Cloud Functions (for tenant creation logic).
- Firestore (for data storage in a specific region).

# 9.0.0 Testing Requirements

## 9.1.0 Testing Types

- Unit
- Integration
- E2E
- Security

## 9.2.0 Test Scenarios

- Verify tenant creation for each supported data residency region.
- Verify that after creating a tenant in Region A, subsequent data writes (e.g., creating a new user) are stored in Region A's database and not in any other region.
- Test form validation for the required region field.
- Test API security by attempting to submit an invalid/unsupported region value.

## 9.3.0 Test Data Needs

- A list of valid, supported regions for testing.
- Test accounts for creating new tenants.

## 9.4.0 Testing Tools

- Firebase Local Emulator Suite for local development.
- Jest for Cloud Function unit tests.
- GCP Console access for manual verification of data location in staging/QA environments.

# 10.0.0 Definition Of Done

- All acceptance criteria validated and passing
- Code reviewed and approved by team
- Unit tests implemented for frontend validation and backend logic, achieving >80% coverage
- Integration testing completed successfully, confirming data is written to the correct regional database
- User interface reviewed and approved for clarity and accessibility
- Security requirements validated, including server-side validation of the region parameter
- Architectural decisions and implementation details are documented in the technical knowledge base
- Story deployed and manually verified by QA in the staging environment for at least two different regions

# 11.0.0 Planning Information

## 11.1.0 Story Points

8

## 11.2.0 Priority

ðŸ”´ High

## 11.3.0 Sprint Considerations

- This story should be preceded by a technical spike to finalize the multi-region architecture.
- Requires close collaboration between frontend, backend, and DevOps/infrastructure engineers.
- The high complexity rating is due to the backend and infrastructure work, not the frontend UI change.

## 11.4.0 Release Impact

- This is a foundational feature for compliance and is likely a prerequisite for launching in certain markets (e.g., the EU).
