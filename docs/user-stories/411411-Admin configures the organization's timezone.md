# 3 Acceptance Criteria

## 3.1 Criteria Id

### 3.1.1 Criteria Id

AC-001

### 3.1.2 Scenario

Admin successfully sets the organization's timezone for the first time

### 3.1.3 Scenario Type

Happy_Path

### 3.1.4 Given

I am an Admin logged into the web dashboard and I am on the 'Tenant Settings' page

### 3.1.5 When

I select a timezone (e.g., 'America/New_York') from the searchable dropdown list and click the 'Save' button

### 3.1.6 Then

I see a success notification stating 'Timezone updated successfully', and the page reflects the new setting. The tenant's configuration document in Firestore is updated with the value 'America/New_York'.

### 3.1.7 Validation Notes

Verify the UI update and check the Firestore document `/tenants/{tenantId}/config/{singletonDoc}` for the `timezone` field.

## 3.2.0 Criteria Id

### 3.2.1 Criteria Id

AC-002

### 3.2.2 Scenario

Admin updates an existing timezone setting

### 3.2.3 Scenario Type

Happy_Path

### 3.2.4 Given

I am an Admin on the 'Tenant Settings' page where a timezone (e.g., 'America/New_York') is already set

### 3.2.5 When

I select a different timezone (e.g., 'Europe/London') and click 'Save'

### 3.2.6 Then

I see a success notification, and the displayed timezone is updated to 'Europe/London'. The corresponding Firestore document is also updated.

### 3.2.7 Validation Notes

Reload the page to ensure the new setting persists and is displayed correctly.

## 3.3.0 Criteria Id

### 3.3.1 Criteria Id

AC-003

### 3.3.2 Scenario

Save button is disabled when no changes are made

### 3.3.3 Scenario Type

Alternative_Flow

### 3.3.4 Given

I am an Admin on the 'Tenant Settings' page

### 3.3.5 When

The page loads with the current timezone setting

### 3.3.6 Then

The 'Save' button is disabled.

### 3.3.7 Validation Notes

The 'Save' button should only become enabled after the user selects a different timezone from the dropdown.

## 3.4.0 Criteria Id

### 3.4.1 Criteria Id

AC-004

### 3.4.2 Scenario

System handles failure to save the timezone

### 3.4.3 Scenario Type

Error_Condition

### 3.4.4 Given

I am an Admin on the 'Tenant Settings' page and I have selected a new timezone

### 3.4.5 When

I click 'Save' and the backend operation fails due to a network error or permission issue

### 3.4.6 Then

I see an error notification like 'Failed to update timezone. Please try again.' and the timezone selection reverts to its original, last-saved value.

### 3.4.7 Validation Notes

Simulate a network failure or use Firestore emulator rules to block the write operation and verify the UI response.

## 3.5.0 Criteria Id

### 3.5.1 Criteria Id

AC-005

### 3.5.2 Scenario

Non-Admin user attempts to access timezone settings

### 3.5.3 Scenario Type

Error_Condition

### 3.5.4 Given

A user with a 'Supervisor' or 'Subordinate' role is logged in

### 3.5.5 When

They attempt to navigate to the 'Tenant Settings' page or make a direct API call to update the timezone

### 3.5.6 Then

They are either redirected away from the page or see a 'Permission Denied' error, and no changes are made.

### 3.5.7 Validation Notes

Test this with Firestore Security Rules to ensure the write to the config document is rejected for non-Admin roles.

## 3.6.0 Criteria Id

### 3.6.1 Criteria Id

AC-006

### 3.6.2 Scenario

Default state for a new tenant

### 3.6.3 Scenario Type

Edge_Case

### 3.6.4 Given

An Admin for a brand new tenant logs in for the first time

### 3.6.5 When

They navigate to the 'Tenant Settings' page

### 3.6.6 Then

The timezone field is either blank or set to a system default (e.g., 'UTC'), and there is a clear visual indicator prompting the Admin to configure it.

### 3.6.7 Validation Notes

Check the UI for a new tenant to confirm a prompt exists to guide the Admin.

# 4.0.0 User Interface Requirements

## 4.1.0 Ui Elements

- A labeled, searchable dropdown menu for timezone selection.
- A 'Save' button that is enabled only when changes are pending.
- Toast/Snackbar notifications for success and error messages.

## 4.2.0 User Interactions

- Admin can type in the dropdown to filter the list of timezones.
- Clicking 'Save' triggers the update and provides immediate visual feedback.

## 4.3.0 Display Requirements

- The dropdown should display user-friendly timezone names (e.g., '(GMT-05:00) Eastern Time'), but store the canonical IANA identifier (e.g., 'America/New_York').
- The currently saved timezone must be displayed when the page loads.

## 4.4.0 Accessibility Needs

- The timezone selector must be fully keyboard accessible (tab to focus, arrows to navigate, enter to select).
- The form element must have a proper label for screen reader compatibility (WCAG 2.1 AA).

# 5.0.0 Business Rules

- {'rule_id': 'BR-001', 'rule_description': 'A timezone must be configured for a tenant for time-based features to function correctly.', 'enforcement_point': 'System-wide. Features like auto-checkout and reporting will fall back to a default (UTC) or show an error if the timezone is not set.', 'violation_handling': 'The Admin dashboard should display a persistent warning if the timezone has not been configured.'}

# 6.0.0 Dependencies

## 6.1.0 Prerequisite Stories

### 6.1.1 Story Id

#### 6.1.1.1 Story Id

US-001

#### 6.1.1.2 Dependency Reason

A tenant must exist before its settings can be configured.

### 6.1.2.0 Story Id

#### 6.1.2.1 Story Id

US-021

#### 6.1.2.2 Dependency Reason

The Admin must be able to log in and access a role-specific web dashboard where the settings page will reside.

## 6.2.0.0 Technical Dependencies

- Firebase Authentication for role-based access control.
- Firebase Firestore for storing the tenant configuration.
- A front-end library to provide a comprehensive list of IANA timezones.

## 6.3.0.0 Data Dependencies

- Requires the existence of a tenant configuration document in Firestore, e.g., `/tenants/{tenantId}/config/{singletonDoc}`.

## 6.4.0.0 External Dependencies

*No items available*

# 7.0.0.0 Non Functional Requirements

## 7.1.0.0 Performance

- The settings page, including the list of timezones, must load in under 2 seconds.

## 7.2.0.0 Security

- Only users with the 'Admin' role, verified by a Firebase Auth custom claim, can modify the timezone setting.
- Firestore Security Rules must enforce this write restriction on the server side.

## 7.3.0.0 Usability

- The timezone list should be searchable to allow the Admin to find their desired timezone quickly.

## 7.4.0.0 Accessibility

- Must comply with WCAG 2.1 Level AA standards.

## 7.5.0.0 Compatibility

- The Admin web dashboard must be functional on the latest stable versions of Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge.

# 8.0.0.0 Implementation Considerations

## 8.1.0.0 Complexity Assessment

Low

## 8.2.0.0 Complexity Factors

- Requires a simple UI change on an existing settings page.
- Backend logic is a single, straightforward Firestore document update.
- Security rules are simple to implement for this specific path.

## 8.3.0.0 Technical Risks

- The primary risk is ensuring that all other time-dependent features correctly reference and utilize this new configuration value. This requires thorough integration testing.

## 8.4.0.0 Integration Points

- Firestore: The setting is stored in `/tenants/{tenantId}/config/`.
- Cloud Functions: Any scheduled function (e.g., Auto-Checkout, Reporting) must read this value to determine its execution context.
- Reporting Engine: All date/time aggregations must be performed relative to this timezone.

# 9.0.0.0 Testing Requirements

## 9.1.0.0 Testing Types

- Unit
- Integration
- E2E
- Accessibility

## 9.2.0.0 Test Scenarios

- Admin sets timezone successfully.
- Admin updates timezone successfully.
- Non-Admin user is blocked from updating.
- UI handles save errors gracefully.
- A dependent feature (e.g., auto-checkout) correctly uses the configured timezone.

## 9.3.0.0 Test Data Needs

- Test accounts with 'Admin', 'Supervisor', and 'Subordinate' roles.
- A test tenant with no timezone set.
- A test tenant with a pre-existing timezone set.

## 9.4.0.0 Testing Tools

- Flutter Test Framework for widget tests.
