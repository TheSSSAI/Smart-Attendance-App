# 3 Acceptance Criteria

## 3.1 Criteria Id

### 3.1.1 Criteria Id

AC-001

### 3.1.2 Scenario

Successful sync of a single offline check-in record

### 3.1.3 Scenario Type

Happy_Path

### 3.1.4 Given

a user is logged in on the mobile app but the device is offline

### 3.1.5 When

the user performs a check-in, and the device later regains a stable internet connection

### 3.1.6 Then

the Firestore SDK automatically detects the connection and syncs the pending write operation to the server

### 3.1.7 And

the user's local attendance history view is updated to show the record as successfully synced (e.g., any 'pending' indicator is removed).

### 3.1.8 Validation Notes

Verify by enabling airplane mode, checking in, disabling airplane mode, and confirming the record appears in the Firestore console with the correct flag.

## 3.2.0 Criteria Id

### 3.2.1 Criteria Id

AC-002

### 3.2.2 Scenario

Successful sync of a single offline check-out record

### 3.2.3 Scenario Type

Happy_Path

### 3.2.4 Given

a user has a synced check-in record for the day and the device is now offline

### 3.2.5 When

the user performs a check-out, and the device later regains a stable internet connection

### 3.2.6 Then

the Firestore SDK automatically syncs the pending update to the server

### 3.2.7 And

the record's `flags` array now includes `isOfflineEntry: true`.

### 3.2.8 Validation Notes

Verify by checking in while online, enabling airplane mode, checking out, disabling airplane mode, and confirming the original record is updated in the Firestore console.

## 3.3.0 Criteria Id

### 3.3.1 Criteria Id

AC-003

### 3.3.2 Scenario

Syncing multiple offline records

### 3.3.3 Scenario Type

Happy_Path

### 3.3.4 Given

a user has been offline for an extended period and has created multiple unsynced attendance records (e.g., check-in and check-out for two different days)

### 3.3.5 When

the device regains a stable internet connection

### 3.3.6 Then

all pending offline records are automatically sent to the server

### 3.3.7 And

the user's local attendance history shows all records as successfully synced.

### 3.3.8 Validation Notes

Simulate multiple offline check-ins/outs over 2+ days in airplane mode, then reconnect and verify all records appear correctly in Firestore.

## 3.4.0 Criteria Id

### 3.4.1 Criteria Id

AC-004

### 3.4.2 Scenario

Sync process is non-blocking for the user interface

### 3.4.3 Scenario Type

Alternative_Flow

### 3.4.4 Given

the application is in the process of syncing offline data after regaining connectivity

### 3.4.5 When

the user navigates to other parts of the application

### 3.4.6 Then

the UI remains responsive and is not blocked by the background sync process.

### 3.4.7 Validation Notes

While a sync is in progress (can be simulated with network throttling), navigate through the app's UI to ensure there is no freezing or jank.

## 3.5.0 Criteria Id

### 3.5.1 Criteria Id

AC-005

### 3.5.2 Scenario

Sync is attempted while app is in the background

### 3.5.3 Scenario Type

Edge_Case

### 3.5.4 Given

a user has created an offline record and then minimized the application

### 3.5.5 When

the device regains internet connectivity while the app is in the background

### 3.5.6 Then

the sync process is initiated by the operating system and the Firestore SDK (within platform limitations).

### 3.5.7 Validation Notes

This is best-effort and platform-dependent. Test by checking in offline, backgrounding the app, reconnecting to the network, waiting a few minutes, then opening the app to see if the data has synced or syncs upon foregrounding.

## 3.6.0 Criteria Id

### 3.6.1 Criteria Id

AC-006

### 3.6.2 Scenario

Sync fails due to transient network error

### 3.6.3 Scenario Type

Error_Condition

### 3.6.4 Given

an automatic sync process has started but the network connection is lost mid-sync

### 3.6.5 When

the write operation to Firestore fails

### 3.6.6 Then

the local data is preserved in its unsynced state

### 3.6.7 And

the system will automatically retry the sync when a stable connection is detected again.

### 3.6.8 Validation Notes

Use network throttling tools or quickly toggle airplane mode during a sync to simulate a dropped connection and verify the retry mechanism.

# 4.0.0 User Interface Requirements

## 4.1.0 Ui Elements

- Optional: A subtle, non-intrusive icon or text label (e.g., 'Sync pending') on attendance list items that are not yet synced.

## 4.2.0 User Interactions

- The core functionality requires NO user interaction; the sync must be fully automatic.
- If a 'Sync pending' indicator is used, it must automatically disappear upon successful synchronization without requiring a manual refresh.

## 4.3.0 Display Requirements

- The system must provide clear visual differentiation between synced and unsynced records in the user's attendance history.

## 4.4.0 Accessibility Needs

- If a visual sync status indicator is used, it must have a proper content description for screen readers (e.g., 'Attendance record, January 17th, Sync pending').

# 5.0.0 Business Rules

- {'rule_id': 'BR-SYNC-001', 'rule_description': 'Offline records must be synced to the server automatically when a network connection becomes available.', 'enforcement_point': 'Application-wide, handled by the data layer service that interacts with the Firestore SDK.', 'violation_handling': 'If automatic sync fails persistently, the system should trigger the notification mechanism defined in US-035.'}

# 6.0.0 Dependencies

## 6.1.0 Prerequisite Stories

- {'story_id': 'US-033', 'dependency_reason': 'This story depends on the ability to create and store attendance records locally while the device is offline. US-033 implements the local caching mechanism.'}

## 6.2.0 Technical Dependencies

- Firebase Firestore SDK for Flutter, with offline persistence enabled.
- A connectivity detection package (e.g., `connectivity_plus`) to monitor network state changes, if more granular control is needed beyond the SDK's default behavior.

## 6.3.0 Data Dependencies

- Requires locally cached attendance records that have a flag or state indicating they are pending synchronization.

## 6.4.0 External Dependencies

- Reliant on the availability of the Firebase Firestore service.

# 7.0.0 Non Functional Requirements

## 7.1.0 Performance

- The sync process must run in a background thread to avoid blocking the UI.
- The process should be optimized to minimize battery consumption, especially when handling background sync retries.

## 7.2.0 Security

- All data synchronized between the client and Firestore must be transmitted over a secure (TLS) connection, which is handled by the Firebase SDK by default.

## 7.3.0 Usability

- The sync process should be seamless and invisible to the user during normal operation.

## 7.4.0 Accessibility

- N/A for the background process itself, but any related UI indicators must be accessible.

## 7.5.0 Compatibility

- The sync mechanism must be tested and verified to work reliably on supported versions of Android (6.0+) and iOS (12.0+), considering platform-specific background execution policies.

# 8.0.0 Implementation Considerations

## 8.1.0 Complexity Assessment

Medium

## 8.2.0 Complexity Factors

- The core functionality is heavily supported by the Firestore SDK, which reduces complexity.
- Complexity increases when ensuring reliable background sync, which is subject to strict OS limitations (especially on iOS).
- Handling transient network errors and implementing a robust retry mechanism requires careful state management.

## 8.3.0 Technical Risks

- Platform-specific restrictions on background tasks may delay or prevent synchronization until the app is brought to the foreground.
- A large backlog of offline data could lead to high initial network usage upon reconnection, which needs to be managed gracefully.

## 8.4.0 Integration Points

- Integrates directly with the Firebase Firestore backend.
- The local data persistence layer (managed by the Firestore SDK cache).

# 9.0.0 Testing Requirements

## 9.1.0 Testing Types

- Unit
- Integration
- E2E
- Manual

## 9.2.0 Test Scenarios

- Device goes from offline to online with one pending record.
- Device goes from offline to online with multiple pending records.
- Sync is interrupted by network loss and successfully retries later.
- App is backgrounded, network is restored, and sync occurs.
- Verify `isOfflineEntry` flag is correctly set on synced records.

## 9.3.0 Test Data Needs

- Test user accounts for Subordinate role.
- Ability to simulate offline/online network states on test devices/emulators.

## 9.4.0 Testing Tools

- Firebase Local Emulator Suite for integration testing without real network calls.
- Flutter's integration_test framework.
- Device-level network controls (Airplane Mode) and developer tools for network throttling.

# 10.0.0 Definition Of Done
