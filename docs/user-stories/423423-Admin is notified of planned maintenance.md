# 4.0.0 User Interface Requirements

## 4.1.0 Ui Elements

- A persistent banner component for the Admin web dashboard.
- A static HTML page for displaying maintenance-in-progress information.
- An HTML email template for maintenance notifications.

## 4.2.0 User Interactions

- The in-app banner is for display only and is not interactive or dismissible by the user.

## 4.3.0 Display Requirements

- Banner must display: 'Planned Maintenance', start date/time, end date/time, and impact summary.
- Email must display: Clear subject, start/end times with timezone, detailed impact description, and contact info for support.
- Maintenance page must display: System unavailable message, expected end time.

## 4.4.0 Accessibility Needs

- The in-app banner must have sufficient color contrast and be readable by screen readers, adhering to WCAG 2.1 Level AA (REQ-INT-001).
- The email template must use semantic HTML for accessibility.

# 5.0.0 Business Rules

- {'rule_id': 'BR-001', 'rule_description': 'Initial maintenance notifications must be sent at least 48 hours prior to the maintenance start time.', 'enforcement_point': 'Backend notification scheduler (Cloud Function).', 'violation_handling': 'The scheduling process should log an error if an attempt is made to schedule a notification inside the 48-hour window without a manual override.'}

# 6.0.0 Dependencies

## 6.1.0 Prerequisite Stories

### 6.1.1 Story Id

#### 6.1.1.1 Story Id

US-001

#### 6.1.1.2 Dependency Reason

Requires the existence of Admin users and tenants to send notifications to.

### 6.1.2.0 Story Id

#### 6.1.2.1 Story Id

US-021

#### 6.1.2.2 Dependency Reason

Requires the Admin web dashboard to exist as a location to display the in-app banner.

## 6.2.0.0 Technical Dependencies

- Firebase Cloud Functions for scheduled job execution.
- Firebase Firestore for storing maintenance window data.
- SendGrid integration (via Firebase Extension as per REQ-SCP-001) for sending emails.
- Firebase Hosting for serving the maintenance page.

## 6.3.0.0 Data Dependencies

- A new Firestore collection, e.g., `/systemMaintenance`, to store details of maintenance windows (startTime, endTime, impact, status).

## 6.4.0.0 External Dependencies

- An internal process/tool for system operators to create, update, and cancel maintenance window records in Firestore.

# 7.0.0.0 Non Functional Requirements

## 7.1.0.0 Performance

- The check for an active maintenance window on dashboard load must not add more than 100ms to the page load time.

## 7.2.0.0 Security

- The public-facing maintenance page must not expose any internal system details or error messages.

## 7.3.0.0 Usability

- All notifications (email and in-app) must be written in clear, non-technical language.

## 7.4.0.0 Accessibility

- All user-facing components (banner, email, maintenance page) must comply with WCAG 2.1 Level AA standards.

## 7.5.0.0 Compatibility

- The in-app banner must render correctly on all supported browsers for the web dashboard (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge as per REQ-DEP-001).

# 8.0.0.0 Implementation Considerations

## 8.1.0.0 Complexity Assessment

Medium

## 8.2.0.0 Complexity Factors

- Requires creation of a new backend data model and scheduled function.
- Requires modification of the core authentication flow to handle the 'in-maintenance' state.
- Requires a robust process for sending notifications to potentially thousands of Admins.
- Timezone handling for maintenance windows must be precise and clearly communicated.

## 8.3.0.0 Technical Risks

- The email-sending function must handle batching or throttling to avoid being blocked by the email provider when notifying a large number of Admins.
- Incorrect timezone calculations could lead to sending notifications at the wrong time or displaying incorrect information.

## 8.4.0.0 Integration Points

- Firebase Authentication (to intercept login attempts).
- Firestore (to read maintenance data).
- Cloud Functions (to run the scheduler).
- SendGrid API (to send emails).

# 9.0.0.0 Testing Requirements

- Integration
- E2E

## 9.2.0.0 Test Scenarios

- Verify email content and delivery for new, rescheduled, and cancelled maintenance.
- Verify in-app banner visibility and content for new and rescheduled maintenance.
- Verify banner is removed after cancellation or completion of maintenance.
- Verify login redirection to the maintenance page during an active window.
- Verify timezone information is displayed correctly in all notifications.

## 9.3.0.0 Test Data Needs

- Ability to create, update, and delete maintenance window records in the test Firestore database with various start/end times.

## 9.4.0.0 Testing Tools

# 11.0.0.0 Planning Information

## 11.1.0.0 Story Points

5

## 11.2.0.0 Priority

ðŸ”´ High

## 11.3.0.0 Sprint Considerations

- This story requires both backend (Cloud Function) and frontend (Flutter Web) development effort, which should be coordinated.
- The internal mechanism for creating maintenance records needs to be in place before this story can be fully tested.

## 11.4.0.0 Release Impact

This is a foundational feature for service reliability and customer communication. It should be included in an early release to build trust with tenant Admins.
