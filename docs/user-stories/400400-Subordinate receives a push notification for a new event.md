### 3.1.3 Scenario Type

Happy_Path

### 3.1.4 Given

a Subordinate is logged into the mobile app and has granted notification permissions

### 3.1.5 When

a Supervisor creates a new event and assigns it directly to that Subordinate

### 3.1.6 Then

the Subordinate's device receives a push notification containing the event title within 30 seconds.

### 3.1.7 Validation Notes

Verify on a physical or emulated device that the notification is received. The trigger is the creation of the event document in Firestore.

## 3.2.0 Criteria Id

### 3.2.1 Criteria Id

AC-002

### 3.2.2 Scenario

Notification for team-based event assignment

### 3.2.3 Scenario Type

Happy_Path

### 3.2.4 Given

a Subordinate is an active member of a team and has granted notification permissions

### 3.2.5 When

a Supervisor creates a new event and assigns it to that team

### 3.2.6 Then

the Subordinate's device receives a push notification containing the event title.

### 3.2.7 Validation Notes

Ensure the backend logic correctly resolves team members and sends notifications to all of them.

## 3.3.0 Criteria Id

### 3.3.1 Criteria Id

AC-003

### 3.3.2 Scenario

Tapping notification opens the event calendar

### 3.3.3 Scenario Type

Happy_Path

### 3.3.4 Given

the Subordinate has received a new event notification and the app is either in the background or closed

### 3.3.5 When

the Subordinate taps the notification

### 3.3.6 Then

the application launches and navigates directly to the user's event calendar view.

### 3.3.7 Validation Notes

Test this from both a 'terminated' and 'backgrounded' app state on both iOS and Android.

## 3.4.0 Criteria Id

### 3.4.1 Criteria Id

AC-004

### 3.4.2 Scenario

No duplicate notifications for multiple assignment paths

### 3.4.3 Scenario Type

Edge_Case

### 3.4.4 Given

a Subordinate is a member of 'Team A' and has granted notification permissions

### 3.4.5 When

a Supervisor creates a single event and assigns it to the Subordinate directly AND to 'Team A' in the same action

### 3.4.6 Then

the Subordinate receives only one push notification for that event.

### 3.4.7 Validation Notes

The backend Cloud Function must de-duplicate the list of recipient user IDs before sending notifications.

## 3.5.0 Criteria Id

### 3.5.1 Criteria Id

AC-005

### 3.5.2 Scenario

Deactivated users do not receive notifications

### 3.5.3 Scenario Type

Error_Condition

### 3.5.4 Given

a user's account status is set to 'deactivated'

### 3.5.5 When

an event is assigned to a team of which the user was a member

### 3.5.6 Then

the deactivated user does not receive a push notification.

### 3.5.7 Validation Notes

The backend logic must check the user's 'status' field before attempting to send a notification.

## 3.6.0 Criteria Id

### 3.6.1 Criteria Id

AC-006

### 3.6.2 Scenario

User has notifications disabled at the OS level

### 3.6.3 Scenario Type

Error_Condition

### 3.6.4 Given

a Subordinate has disabled notifications for the application in their device's OS settings

### 3.6.5 When

a Supervisor assigns a new event to them

### 3.6.6 Then

the backend sends the notification without error, and the user's device silently discards it as expected.

### 3.6.7 Validation Notes

This is to ensure the backend process does not fail if FCM reports that the user cannot receive the message. No client-side validation is possible.
