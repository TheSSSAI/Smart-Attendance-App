The user navigates to any interactive element (button, text field, toggle, link) on any screen

### 3.1.6 Then

The screen reader clearly announces the element's name, role, and state (e.g., 'Check-In, button', 'Password, text field, secure', 'Receive notifications, switch, on').

### 3.1.7 Validation Notes

Manually test with VoiceOver and TalkBack on all screens. Verify that all interactive elements have appropriate semantic labels.

## 3.2.0 Criteria Id

### 3.2.1 Criteria Id

AC-002

Happy_Path

### 3.2.4 Given

A user is viewing any screen in the application

### 3.2.5 When

Text or a meaningful icon is displayed against a background

### 3.2.6 Then

The contrast ratio meets or exceeds WCAG 2.1 AA standards: 4.5:1 for normal text and 3:1 for large text (18pt/24px or 14pt/19px bold).

### 3.2.7 Validation Notes

Use automated tools like Flutter Inspector's accessibility guidelines or external color contrast analyzers on all UI components and themes.

## 3.3.0 Criteria Id

### 3.3.4 Given

A user is viewing information that indicates a status (e.g., 'Approved', 'Pending', 'Rejected') or an error state

### 3.3.5 When

The status or state is displayed

### 3.3.6 Then

The information is conveyed by more than just color, using a combination of text labels, icons, or patterns.

### 3.3.7 Validation Notes

Review all status indicators, form validation messages, and alerts. Ensure a user can understand the meaning in grayscale.

## 3.4.0 Criteria Id

### 3.4.1 Criteria Id

AC-004

### 3.4.2 Scenario

Adequate Touch Target Size for All Controls

### 3.4.3 Scenario Type

### 3.4.4 Given

A user is interacting with any screen containing tappable elements

### 3.4.5 When

The user attempts to tap a button, icon, or other control

### 3.4.6 Then

The interactive area for the control is at least 44x44 pixels (dp/pt).

### 3.4.7 Validation Notes

Verify using layout inspectors. Pay special attention to icon-only buttons and links within text.

## 3.5.0 Criteria Id

### 3.5.1 Criteria Id

AC-005

### 3.5.2 Scenario

Logical Navigation and Focus Order

### 3.5.3 Scenario Type

Happy_Path

### 3.5.4 Given

A user is navigating a screen using a screen reader or an external keyboard/switch device

### 3.5.5 When

The user swipes or tabs to move to the next element

### 3.5.6 Then

The focus moves in a logical and predictable order that follows the visual layout of the screen.

### 3.5.7 Validation Notes

Manually test navigation flow on all screens using screen reader swipe gestures and a connected Bluetooth keyboard.

## 3.6.0 Criteria Id

### 3.6.1 Criteria Id

AC-006

### 3.6.2 Scenario

Dynamic Content is Announced by Screen Readers

### 3.6.3 Scenario Type

Alternative_Flow

### 3.6.4 Given

A user with a screen reader enabled is on a screen, such as the login page

### 3.6.5 When

An action triggers a dynamic change, such as an error message appearing ('Invalid credentials')

### 3.6.6 Then

The screen reader immediately announces the new information to the user without them needing to manually find it.

### 3.6.7 Validation Notes

Test all forms, modals, and asynchronous operations that display feedback to the user (e.g., snackbars, dialogs, inline error text).

# 4.0.0 User Interface Requirements

## 4.1.0 Ui Elements

- All UI elements must be built with accessibility in mind from the start.

## 4.2.0 User Interactions

- All gestures must have accessible alternatives (e.g., custom swipe actions should be available in an accessibility menu).

## 4.3.0 Display Requirements

- A visible focus indicator must be present for all focusable elements when navigating with a keyboard or switch device.

## 4.4.0 Accessibility Needs

- The entire application must conform to the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 at a Level AA standard, as stated in REQ-INT-001.

# 5.0.0 Business Rules

*No items available*

# 6.0.0 Dependencies

## 6.1.0 Prerequisite Stories

- {'story_id': 'N/A', 'dependency_reason': 'This is a foundational, cross-cutting story. It should be implemented early and applied to all subsequent UI-related stories.'}

## 6.2.0 Technical Dependencies

- Flutter's accessibility framework (Semantics widget, etc.).
- Platform-specific accessibility APIs (VoiceOver, TalkBack).

## 6.3.0 Data Dependencies

*No items available*

## 6.4.0 External Dependencies

*No items available*

# 7.0.0 Non Functional Requirements

## 7.1.0 Performance

- Enabling accessibility features should not introduce noticeable performance degradation or UI lag.

## 7.2.0 Security

*No items available*

## 7.3.0 Usability

- Accessibility improvements should enhance, not detract from, the experience for all users.

## 7.4.0 Accessibility

- This includes but is not limited to Perceivable, Operable, Understandable, and Robust principles.

## 7.5.0 Compatibility

- Accessibility features must be fully functional on all supported OS versions (Android 6.0+ and iOS 12.0+).

# 8.0.0 Implementation Considerations

## 8.1.0 Complexity Assessment

High

## 8.2.0 Complexity Factors

- Requires specialized knowledge of WCAG guidelines and platform-specific accessibility APIs.
- Cannot be fully verified by automated tests; requires extensive and time-consuming manual testing with screen readers.
- Applies to the entire application, not just a single feature, requiring consistent implementation across all screens.
- Custom UI components will require manual implementation of accessibility properties.

## 8.3.0 Technical Risks

- Developer inexperience may lead to incorrect or incomplete implementation.
- Third-party libraries may not be fully accessible, requiring workarounds or replacements.
- Retrofitting accessibility onto existing complex screens can be significantly more difficult than building it in from the start.

## 8.4.0 Integration Points

*No items available*

# 9.0.0 Testing Requirements

## 9.1.0 Testing Types

- Accessibility
- Unit
- Widget
- Manual E2E

- Full application walkthrough using TalkBack on a physical Android device.
- Verification of color contrast ratios on all screens and in both light/dark themes if applicable.
- Verification of touch target sizes for all interactive elements.
- Testing of form submissions and error handling with a screen reader enabled.

- TalkBack (Android built-in)
- Accessibility Scanner (Android app)
- Accessibility Inspector (Xcode)
- Flutter Inspector (Accessibility Debugging)

# 10.0.0 Definition Of Done

- All acceptance criteria are met and have been manually verified on both iOS and Android.
- An accessibility checklist based on WCAG 2.1 AA has been created and applied to all existing screens.
- The global 'Definition of Done' for all future UI stories has been updated to include passing the accessibility checklist.
- Code has been reviewed by a peer, with specific attention to accessibility implementation (e.g., semantic labels).
- Automated accessibility checks (e.g., contrast, target size) are added to the development workflow where feasible.
- The application is verified as accessible in the staging environment.

# 11.0.0 Planning Information
