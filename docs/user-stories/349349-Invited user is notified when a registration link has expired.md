# 4.0.0 User Interface Requirements

## 4.1.0 Ui Elements

- A dedicated, full-screen page for displaying the expired link message.
- A prominent heading element.
- A paragraph element for the explanatory text.
- An optional link/button to the main login page.

## 4.2.0 User Interactions

- The user's only interaction is to read the information and close the browser tab or navigate to the login page if a link is provided.

## 4.3.0 Display Requirements

- The page must be unauthenticated and publicly accessible.
- The page must be visually consistent with the application's branding (logo, colors, typography).
- The error message must be user-friendly and avoid technical jargon.

## 4.4.0 Accessibility Needs

- The page must comply with WCAG 2.1 Level AA standards.
- Text must have a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1.
- All content must be readable by screen readers.

# 5.0.0 Business Rules

- {'rule_id': 'BR-001', 'rule_description': 'User invitation links expire after 24 hours.', 'enforcement_point': 'Server-side (Cloud Function) when a user accesses the invitation URL.', 'violation_handling': "The user is redirected to the 'Invitation Link Expired' page."}

# 6.0.0 Dependencies

## 6.1.0 Prerequisite Stories

### 6.1.1 Story Id

#### 6.1.1.1 Story Id

US-004

#### 6.1.1.2 Dependency Reason

The system must be able to generate and store user invitations before it can handle their expiration.

### 6.1.2.0 Story Id

#### 6.1.2.1 Story Id

US-005

#### 6.1.2.2 Dependency Reason

The system must be able to send an email with a registration link before a user can click on an expired one.

## 6.2.0.0 Technical Dependencies

- Firebase Authentication for user state management.
- Firestore for storing invitation tokens and their expiry timestamps.
- Firebase Cloud Function to handle the server-side validation of the invitation token.
- Flutter for Web to render the informational pages (Expired, Invalid, Already Active).

## 6.3.0.0 Data Dependencies

- Requires an 'invitations' collection in Firestore containing documents with a unique token, user email, status, and an expiry timestamp.

## 6.4.0.0 External Dependencies

*No items available*

# 7.0.0.0 Non Functional Requirements

## 7.1.0.0 Performance

- The token validation and redirection by the Cloud Function should complete in under 500ms (p95).
- The 'Link Expired' page should achieve a Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) of under 2.5 seconds.

## 7.2.0.0 Security

- Token validation must occur exclusively on the server-side to prevent tampering.
- The expired/invalid link page must not expose any personally identifiable information (PII) such as the user's email address.
- Invitation tokens must be cryptographically secure and unique.

## 7.3.0.0 Usability

- The message must be immediately understandable to a non-technical user.
- The next step for the user must be clear and unambiguous.

## 7.4.0.0 Accessibility

- Must meet WCAG 2.1 Level AA standards.

## 7.5.0.0 Compatibility

- The informational page must render correctly on the latest stable versions of Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge.

# 8.0.0.0 Implementation Considerations

## 8.1.0.0 Complexity Assessment

Medium

## 8.2.0.0 Complexity Factors

- Requires a combination of backend (Cloud Function) and frontend (Flutter Web) development.
- Configuration of Firebase Hosting rewrite rules to direct the registration URL path to the Cloud Function for pre-processing is a critical and potentially complex step.
- Requires careful state management for the invitation token (e.g., invited, used, expired).

## 8.3.0.0 Technical Risks

- Incorrect configuration of Firebase Hosting rewrites could lead to the Flutter app loading before the token is validated, causing a poor user experience or errors.
- Timezone issues when comparing the expiry timestamp with the server's current time must be handled carefully.

## 8.4.0.0 Integration Points

- Firebase Hosting -> Firebase Cloud Functions (for URL handling).
- Firebase Cloud Functions -> Firestore (for token validation).

# 9.0.0.0 Testing Requirements

## 9.1.0.0 Testing Types

- Unit
- Integration
- E2E

## 9.2.0.0 Test Scenarios

- Verify the correct page is shown for an expired token.
- Verify the correct page is shown for a completely invalid token.
- Verify the correct page is shown for a token that has already been used to activate an account.
- Verify a valid, non-expired token correctly proceeds to the registration page (negative test for this story).

## 9.3.0.0 Test Data Needs

- A test user invitation with a future expiry timestamp.
- A test user invitation with a past expiry timestamp.
- An invalid token string that does not exist in the database.
- A test user who is already in an 'active' state.

## 9.4.0.0 Testing Tools

- Jest for Cloud Function unit tests.
- flutter_test for Flutter widget tests.
- Firebase Local Emulator Suite for local integration testing.
- A browser automation tool like `integration_test` for E2E testing.

# 10.0.0.0 Definition Of Done

- All acceptance criteria validated and passing
- Code reviewed and approved by team
- Unit tests for the Cloud Function validation logic are implemented with >80% coverage and passing
- Widget tests for the Flutter informational pages are implemented and passing
- Integration testing between Hosting, Cloud Function, and Firestore is completed successfully
- User interface reviewed and approved for clarity and branding consistency
- Security requirements validated, ensuring no PII is leaked
- Documentation for the invitation flow is updated to include this error state
- Story deployed and verified in the staging environment

# 11.0.0.0 Planning Information

## 11.1.0.0 Story Points

3

## 11.2.0.0 Priority

ðŸ”´ High

## 11.3.0.0 Sprint Considerations

- This is a critical part of the user invitation workflow and should be prioritized with the main registration stories (US-004, US-005, US-006) to provide a complete and robust onboarding experience.

## 11.4.0.0 Release Impact

- Essential for the initial public release. Launching without this feature would create a frustrating dead-end for users with expired links, leading to a poor first impression and increased support load.
