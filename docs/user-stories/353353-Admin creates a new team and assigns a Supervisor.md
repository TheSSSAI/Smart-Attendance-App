# 4.0.0 User Interface Requirements

## 4.1.0 Ui Elements

- A 'Create Team' button on the main team management screen.
- A modal dialog for the team creation form.
- A text input field for 'Team Name'.
- A searchable dropdown/autocomplete component for 'Assign Supervisor'.
- A 'Save' button, which is disabled until all required fields are valid.
- A 'Cancel' button.

## 4.2.0 User Interactions

- Clicking 'Create Team' opens the creation modal.
- Typing in the Supervisor dropdown filters the list of eligible users.
- Selecting a user from the dropdown populates the field.
- Clicking 'Save' with valid data closes the modal and refreshes the team list.
- Clicking 'Cancel' closes the modal with no changes.

## 4.3.0 Display Requirements

- The Supervisor dropdown should display the user's full name and email to avoid ambiguity.
- Real-time inline validation messages for required fields and duplicate names must be shown.

## 4.4.0 Accessibility Needs

- All form fields must have associated labels for screen readers.
- The modal must be keyboard navigable, and focus must be trapped within it.
- Error messages must be associated with their respective form fields using `aria-describedby`.

# 6.0.0 Dependencies

## 6.1.0 Prerequisite Stories

### 6.1.1 Story Id

#### 6.1.1.1 Story Id

US-001

#### 6.1.1.2 Dependency Reason

A tenant must exist before a team can be created within it.

### 6.1.2.0 Story Id

#### 6.1.2.1 Story Id

US-004

#### 6.1.2.2 Dependency Reason

Users must be created and assigned roles (specifically 'Supervisor') before they can be assigned to lead a team.

## 6.2.0.0 Technical Dependencies

- Firebase Authentication for Admin role verification.
- Firestore for storing team data and querying for existing users.
- Flutter for Web framework for the Admin dashboard UI.

## 6.3.0.0 Data Dependencies

- Requires access to the `/tenants/{tenantId}/users` collection to populate the list of potential supervisors.

## 6.4.0.0 External Dependencies

*No items available*

# 7.0.0.0 Non Functional Requirements

## 7.1.0.0 Performance

- The list of potential supervisors in the dropdown should load in under 2 seconds for a tenant with up to 1,000 users.

## 7.2.0.0 Security

- Firestore Security Rules must ensure that only an authenticated user with the 'Admin' custom claim for the correct `tenantId` can create documents in the `/teams` subcollection.
- Input validation must be performed on the team name to prevent injection attacks.

## 7.3.0.0 Usability

- The process of creating a team should be intuitive and require minimal steps.
- Error feedback must be clear, immediate, and guide the user to a solution.

## 7.4.0.0 Accessibility

- The feature must comply with WCAG 2.1 Level AA standards.

## 7.5.0.0 Compatibility

- The Admin web dashboard must function correctly on the latest stable versions of Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge.

# 8.0.0.0 Implementation Considerations

## 8.1.0.0 Complexity Assessment

Medium

## 8.2.0.0 Complexity Factors

- Implementing the searchable, paginated dropdown for supervisor selection to ensure performance with a large number of users.
- Writing and thoroughly testing the Firestore Security Rules to prevent unauthorized creation.
- Ensuring robust client-side and server-side validation for unique team names to prevent race conditions.

## 8.3.0.0 Technical Risks

- Poor query performance when fetching the list of supervisors if the database is not indexed correctly.
- Potential for a race condition if two admins try to create a team with the same name simultaneously. This should be handled by Firestore's transaction or security rules.

## 8.4.0.0 Integration Points

- Reads from the `/users` collection.
- Writes to the `/teams` collection.

# 9.0.0.0 Testing Requirements

## 9.1.0.0 Testing Types

- Unit
- Widget (Flutter)
- Integration
- Security

## 9.2.0.0 Test Scenarios

- Verify successful team creation and its appearance in the UI.
- Test all validation rules: duplicate name, empty name, no supervisor selected.
- Test the supervisor dropdown filtering logic.
- Test the 'Cancel' functionality.
- Write security rule tests to confirm a non-admin user or an admin from another tenant cannot create a team.
- Test the UI's responsiveness on different screen sizes.

## 9.3.0.0 Test Data Needs

- A test tenant with multiple users, including some with 'Supervisor' roles and some without.
- A test tenant with at least one existing team to test the duplicate name validation.

## 9.4.0.0 Testing Tools

## 11.3.0.0 Sprint Considerations

- This is a foundational story and a blocker for any features related to team management or team-based assignments (e.g., US-014, US-015, US-055). It should be prioritized early in the development cycle.
