Happy_Path

### 3.1.4 Given

The Admin is logged into the web dashboard and is on the 'Bulk Import' page

### 3.1.5 When

The Admin uploads a correctly formatted CSV file containing users and teams that do not yet exist in the tenant

### 3.1.6 Then

The system initiates an asynchronous background job to process the file, and the UI shows a 'Processing' status.

### 3.1.7 And

Upon completion, the Admin is notified and can view a summary report (as per US-084).

### 3.1.8 Validation Notes

Verify in Firestore that user and team documents are created correctly. Check email service logs (e.g., SendGrid) to confirm invitation emails were sent.

## 3.2.0 Criteria Id

### 3.2.1 Criteria Id

AC-002

### 3.2.2 Scenario

Importing users into existing teams

### 3.2.3 Scenario Type

Happy_Path

### 3.2.4 Given

The Admin uploads a CSV file where users are assigned to teams that already exist in the tenant

### 3.2.5 When

The import process runs

### 3.2.6 Then

The system does not create duplicate teams but correctly adds the new users as members of the existing teams.

### 3.2.7 Validation Notes

Verify that no new team documents are created and that the `memberIds` array in the existing team documents is updated correctly.

## 3.3.0 Criteria Id

### 3.3.1 Criteria Id

Attempting to upload a file with an incorrect format

### 3.3.3 Scenario Type

Error_Condition

### 3.3.4 Given

The Admin is on the 'Bulk Import' page

### 3.3.5 When

The Admin attempts to upload a file that is not a CSV (e.g., .xlsx, .txt, .jpg)

### 3.3.6 Then

The UI immediately rejects the file and displays an inline error message: 'Invalid file type. Please upload a .csv file.'

### 3.3.7 Validation Notes

Test with multiple non-CSV file extensions to ensure the client-side validation works.

## 3.4.0 Criteria Id

### 3.4.1 Criteria Id

AC-004

### 3.4.2 Scenario

Uploading a CSV with incorrect or missing headers

### 3.4.3 Scenario Type

Error_Condition

### 3.4.4 Given

The Admin is on the 'Bulk Import' page

### 3.4.5 When

The Admin uploads a CSV file with headers that do not match the required template (e.g., 'email_address' instead of 'email')

### 3.4.6 Then

The system rejects the file immediately after parsing the header row and displays an error message detailing the header mismatch.

### 3.4.7 Validation Notes

The backend processing function should perform this check before processing any data rows.

## 3.5.0 Criteria Id

### 3.5.1 Criteria Id

AC-005

### 3.5.2 Scenario

Processing a CSV with some invalid data rows

### 3.5.3 Scenario Type

### 3.5.5 When

The import process runs

### 3.5.6 Then

The system successfully processes all valid rows, creating users and teams as expected.

### 3.5.7 And

The final summary report (US-084) clearly lists which rows succeeded and which failed, with specific reasons for each failure (e.g., 'Row 5: Invalid email format', 'Row 8: Required field 'supervisorEmail' is missing').

### 3.5.8 Validation Notes

Check Firestore to confirm only valid users were created. Check the generated report to ensure error messages are accurate and row-specific.

## 3.6.0 Criteria Id

### 3.6.1 Criteria Id

AC-006

### 3.6.2 Scenario

Attempting to import a user whose email already exists

### 3.6.3 Scenario Type

Edge_Case

### 3.6.4 Given

A user with the email 'existing.user@example.com' already has an 'active' or 'invited' status in the tenant

### 3.6.5 When

The Admin uploads a CSV file containing a row to create a user with the email 'existing.user@example.com'

### 3.6.6 Then

The system skips that row during processing.

### 3.6.7 And

The summary report (US-084) indicates that the row failed with the reason 'User with this email already exists.'

### 3.6.8 Validation Notes

Ensure no data for the existing user is modified and the error is correctly reported.

## 3.7.0 Criteria Id

### 3.7.1 Criteria Id

AC-007

### 3.7.2 Scenario

Importing a user with a supervisor who does not exist

### 3.7.3 Scenario Type

### 3.7.4 Given

The Admin uploads a CSV file where a user's `supervisorEmail` does not correspond to any existing user or any other user being created in the same file

### 3.7.5 When

The import process runs

### 3.7.6 Then

The system skips that row.

### 3.7.7 And

The summary report (US-084) indicates the row failed with the reason 'Specified supervisor email not found.'

### 3.7.8 Validation Notes

The processing logic must be able to resolve supervisor references within the same batch upload.

## 3.8.0 Criteria Id

### 3.8.1 Criteria Id

AC-008

### 3.8.2 Scenario

Attempting to create a circular reporting structure

### 3.8.3 Scenario Type

Edge_Case

### 3.8.4 Given

The Admin uploads a CSV file where User A's supervisor is User B, and User B's supervisor is User A

### 3.8.5 When

The import process runs

### 3.8.6 Then

The system detects the circular dependency.

### 3.8.7 And

The summary report (US-084) indicates the rows failed with the reason 'Circular reporting structure detected.'

### 3.8.8 Validation Notes

This requires the import logic to build a dependency graph or perform checks against the reporting chain before committing data.

# 11.0.0.0 Planning Information

## 11.1.0.0 Story Points

8

## 11.2.0.0 Priority

🔴 High

## 11.3.0.0 Sprint Considerations

- This story is a cornerstone for the data migration feature set. It has a hard dependency on US-082 and is tightly coupled with US-084 (viewing the report). It is recommended to plan US-083 and US-084 in the same or consecutive sprints.
- Requires both frontend (Flutter Web) and backend (Cloud Function) development effort.

## 11.4.0.0 Release Impact

- Enables a key onboarding workflow for new tenants, particularly those with more than a handful of users. Its absence would be a major barrier to adoption for medium-to-large organizations.
