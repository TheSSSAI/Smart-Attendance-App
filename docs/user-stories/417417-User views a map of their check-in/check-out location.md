# 3 Acceptance Criteria

## 3.1 Criteria Id

### 3.1.1 Criteria Id

AC-001

### 3.1.2 Scenario

Display map with both check-in and check-out locations

### 3.1.3 Scenario Type

Happy_Path

### 3.1.4 Given

a user is viewing the details of an attendance record that has valid GPS coordinates for both check-in and check-out

### 3.1.5 When

the attendance detail screen loads

### 3.1.6 Then

a map component is displayed, showing two distinct, clearly labeled pins for the check-in and check-out locations, and the map is zoomed and centered to encompass both pins.

### 3.1.7 Validation Notes

Verify that two pins are visible. The check-in pin could be green and the check-out pin red for clarity. The map view should be interactive (pannable and zoomable).

## 3.2.0 Criteria Id

### 3.2.1 Criteria Id

AC-002

### 3.2.2 Scenario

Display map with only a check-in location

### 3.2.3 Scenario Type

Happy_Path

### 3.2.4 Given

a user is viewing the details of an attendance record that has valid GPS coordinates for check-in but has not yet been checked-out

### 3.2.5 When

the attendance detail screen loads

### 3.2.6 Then

a map component is displayed, showing a single pin for the check-in location, and the map is centered on this pin at a reasonable default zoom level.

### 3.2.7 Validation Notes

Verify only one pin is displayed and the map is centered on it.

## 3.3.0 Criteria Id

### 3.3.1 Criteria Id

AC-003

### 3.3.2 Scenario

User interacts with a location pin

### 3.3.3 Scenario Type

Happy_Path

### 3.3.4 Given

a map is displayed with one or more location pins

### 3.3.5 When

the user taps on a pin

### 3.3.6 Then

an info window appears above the pin, displaying the action type ('Check-In' or 'Check-Out') and the corresponding timestamp from the attendance record.

### 3.3.7 Validation Notes

Tap each pin type and verify the correct information is displayed in the info window.

## 3.4.0 Criteria Id

### 3.4.1 Criteria Id

AC-004

### 3.4.2 Scenario

Attendance record has no location data

### 3.4.3 Scenario Type

Edge_Case

### 3.4.4 Given

a user is viewing an attendance record where the GPS data is null or missing

### 3.4.5 When

the attendance detail screen loads

### 3.4.6 Then

the map component is not displayed, and a user-friendly message, such as 'Location data not available for this record', is shown in its place.

### 3.4.7 Validation Notes

Test with a Firestore document where the `checkInGps` field is null or absent. The app should not crash.

## 3.5.0 Criteria Id

### 3.5.1 Criteria Id

AC-005

### 3.5.2 Scenario

Device is offline when viewing the map

### 3.5.3 Scenario Type

Error_Condition

### 3.5.4 Given

the user's device has no active internet connection

### 3.5.5 When

the user navigates to an attendance detail screen with valid GPS data

### 3.5.6 Then

the map area displays a placeholder with a message like 'Map cannot be loaded. Please check your internet connection.' and the application does not crash.

### 3.5.7 Validation Notes

Enable airplane mode on the device and navigate to the screen. Verify the graceful failure message.

## 3.6.0 Criteria Id

### 3.6.1 Criteria Id

AC-006

### 3.6.2 Scenario

Map service API fails

### 3.6.3 Scenario Type

Error_Condition

### 3.6.4 Given

the Google Maps API service is unavailable or the API key is invalid

### 3.6.5 When

the user navigates to an attendance detail screen

### 3.6.6 Then

the map area displays a generic error message, such as 'Map service is temporarily unavailable.'

### 3.6.7 Validation Notes

This can be simulated by using an invalid API key during testing. The app must handle the API error without crashing.

# 4.0.0 User Interface Requirements

## 4.1.0 Ui Elements

- Embedded map view component within the attendance detail screen.
- Custom map pins/markers for 'Check-In' and 'Check-Out'.
- Info window/tooltip that appears on pin tap.
- Placeholder text area for error states (no data, no network).

## 4.2.0 User Interactions

- User can pan and zoom the map using standard touch gestures.
- Tapping a pin reveals more information.
- Tapping the map background dismisses the info window.

## 4.3.0 Display Requirements

- The map must clearly distinguish between check-in and check-out locations.
- The info window must display the action type and timestamp.

## 4.4.0 Accessibility Needs

- Color contrast for map pins and labels must be sufficient (WCAG 2.1 AA).
- Text within info windows must be readable by screen readers.
- The map component should have a descriptive label for screen readers, e.g., 'Map showing check-in and check-out locations.'

# 5.0.0 Business Rules

# 6.0.0 Dependencies

## 6.1.0 Prerequisite Stories

### 6.1.1 Story Id

#### 6.1.1.1 Story Id

US-028

#### 6.1.1.2 Dependency Reason

This story depends on the functionality to capture and store GPS coordinates upon check-in.

### 6.1.2.0 Story Id

#### 6.1.2.1 Story Id

US-029

#### 6.1.2.2 Dependency Reason

This story depends on the functionality to capture and store GPS coordinates upon check-out.

## 6.2.0.0 Technical Dependencies

- Integration with the Google Maps SDK for Flutter (`google_maps_flutter` package).
- Valid Google Maps API keys for both Android and iOS platforms, configured securely.
- Firestore SDK for retrieving attendance records with GeoPoint data.

## 6.3.0.0 Data Dependencies
