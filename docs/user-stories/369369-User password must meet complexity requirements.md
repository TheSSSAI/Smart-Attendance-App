# 4.0.0 User Interface Requirements

## 4.1.0 Ui Elements

- Password input field
- Confirm Password input field
- A dynamic checklist of password requirements (e.g., 'Minimum 8 characters', 'At least one uppercase letter', etc.)
- Visual indicators (e.g., checkmark/cross icons) next to each requirement
- A disabled-by-default 'Submit' or 'Set Password' button
- An error message area for password mismatch notifications

## 4.2.0 User Interactions

- As the user types in the password field, the checklist updates in real-time.
- The 'Submit' button is only enabled when all password requirements are met AND the confirmation password matches.
- Toggling password visibility (show/hide) should be available.

## 4.3.0 Display Requirements

- The password policy rules must be clearly displayed to the user at all times during password entry.

## 4.4.0 Accessibility Needs

- Color alone must not be used to indicate success or failure of a requirement. Icons (e.g., checkmark, 'x') must be used.
- All UI elements, including the checklist and error messages, must be accessible to screen readers.

# 5.0.0 Business Rules

## 5.1.0 Rule Id

### 5.1.1 Rule Id

BR-001

### 5.1.2 Rule Description

The default password policy requires a minimum of 8 characters, at least one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, one number, and one special character from the set: !@#$%^&*()_+-=[]{};':"\|,.<>/?~

### 5.1.3 Enforcement Point

Client-side (for user feedback) and Server-side (for security) during user registration and password reset.

### 5.1.4 Violation Handling

The user is prevented from setting the password. The UI provides real-time feedback on which rules are not met.

## 5.2.0 Rule Id

### 5.2.1 Rule Id

BR-002

### 5.2.2 Rule Description

The password policy used for validation must be the one configured for the specific tenant. If no custom policy is configured, the system default (BR-001) must be used.

### 5.2.3 Enforcement Point

Client-side and Server-side logic must first fetch the tenant's configuration before performing validation.

### 5.2.4 Violation Handling

Validation fails against the incorrect policy, potentially locking out users or creating security holes.

# 6.0.0 Dependencies

## 6.1.0 Prerequisite Stories

### 6.1.1 Story Id

#### 6.1.1.1 Story Id

US-006

#### 6.1.1.2 Dependency Reason

This story implements the password validation UI and logic required when an invited user completes their registration.

### 6.1.2.0 Story Id

#### 6.1.2.1 Story Id

US-020

#### 6.1.2.2 Dependency Reason

This story implements the password validation UI and logic required when a user resets their forgotten password.

## 6.2.0.0 Technical Dependencies

- Firebase Authentication for creating/updating user credentials.
- Firebase Cloud Functions for secure server-side enforcement of the password policy.
- Firebase Firestore for storing and retrieving tenant-specific password policies (related to US-073).

## 6.3.0.0 Data Dependencies

- Access to the tenant's configuration document in Firestore to retrieve the applicable password policy.

## 6.4.0.0 External Dependencies

*No items available*

# 7.0.0.0 Non Functional Requirements

## 7.1.0.0 Performance

- Client-side validation logic must execute in real-time without introducing any noticeable typing lag for the user.

## 7.2.0.0 Security

- Password complexity rules MUST be enforced on the server-side (e.g., in a Cloud Function) to prevent client-side bypass.
- Passwords must never be logged or stored in plain text.

## 7.3.0.0 Usability

- Feedback on password requirements must be immediate, clear, and easy to understand.

## 7.4.0.0 Accessibility

- The feature must comply with WCAG 2.1 Level AA standards.

## 7.5.0.0 Compatibility

- The feature must function correctly on all supported mobile OS versions (Android 6.0+, iOS 12.0+) and web browsers.

# 8.0.0.0 Implementation Considerations

## 8.1.0.0 Complexity Assessment

Medium

## 8.2.0.0 Complexity Factors

- Requires both client-side (Flutter) and server-side (Cloud Function) implementation.
- Logic must be designed to handle configurable policies per tenant (dependency on US-073), not just a hardcoded default.
- The validation UI component must be reusable across multiple screens (registration, password reset).

## 8.3.0.0 Technical Risks

- Forgetting to implement or properly test the server-side validation would create a major security vulnerability.
- Failure to gracefully handle cases where a tenant's custom policy cannot be fetched from Firestore could lock users out. A secure default must be used as a fallback.

## 8.4.0.0 Integration Points

- User registration flow.
- Password reset flow.
- Initial Admin setup flow.

# 9.0.0.0 Testing Requirements

## 9.1.0.0 Testing Types

- Unit
- Widget (Flutter)
- Integration
- E2E
- Security
- Accessibility

## 9.2.0.0 Test Scenarios

- Test password validation logic with a comprehensive set of valid and invalid inputs for each rule.
- Test the UI component to ensure visual feedback is accurate and timely.
- Test the end-to-end flow of setting a valid password.
- Test the end-to-end flow of attempting to set an invalid password.
- Perform a security test by attempting to submit an invalid password directly to the backend API, bypassing the client UI.

## 9.3.0.0 Test Data Needs

- A list of test passwords covering all rules and edge cases.
- A test tenant with a custom password policy to verify configurability.
- A test tenant using the default password policy.

## 9.4.0.0 Testing Tools

- flutter_test
- integration_test
- Jest (for Cloud Functions)
- Postman or similar API tool for security testing.

# 10.0.0.0 Definition Of Done

- All acceptance criteria validated and passing
- Code reviewed and approved by team
- Unit and widget tests implemented with >80% coverage for the validation logic
- Server-side validation logic implemented in a Cloud Function and tested
- Integration testing completed successfully for registration and password reset flows
- User interface reviewed and approved for clarity and accessibility
- Security requirements validated, including a test to bypass client-side checks
- Documentation for the password validation component is created
- Story deployed and verified in staging environment

# 11.0.0.0 Planning Information

## 11.1.0.0 Story Points

5

## 11.2.0.0 Priority

🔴 High

## 11.3.0.0 Sprint Considerations

- This is a foundational security feature and should be completed before the user registration or password reset stories are considered fully 'done'.
- The implementation should account for the future configurability from US-073, even if that story is not in the same sprint.

## 11.4.0.0 Release Impact

- Critical for the initial release to ensure baseline security for all user accounts.
