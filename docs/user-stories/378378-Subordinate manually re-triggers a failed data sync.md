# 3 Acceptance Criteria

## 3.1 Criteria Id

### 3.1.1 Criteria Id

AC-001

### 3.1.2 Scenario

Successful manual re-sync of a failed record

### 3.1.3 Scenario Type

Happy_Path

### 3.1.4 Given

I am a Subordinate user with an attendance record that was created offline and has failed to sync for over 24 hours, resulting in a persistent 'Sync Failed' notification being displayed for that record.

### 3.1.5 When

I tap the 'Retry Sync' button associated with the failed record while my device has a stable internet connection.

### 3.1.6 Then



```
The system must display a visual indicator that a sync is in progress (e.g., a loading spinner).
AND the system must re-attempt to write the local record to Firestore.
AND upon successful synchronization, the 'Sync Failed' notification for that specific record must be removed.
AND the attendance record's UI should update to reflect its new server status (e.g., 'Pending Approval').
```

### 3.1.7 Validation Notes

Verify in Firestore that the record now exists with the correct data and the `isOfflineEntry` flag set to true. Verify on the client that the UI correctly reflects the successful sync.

## 3.2.0 Criteria Id

### 3.2.1 Criteria Id

AC-002

### 3.2.2 Scenario

Manual re-sync attempt fails due to no internet connectivity

### 3.2.3 Scenario Type

Error_Condition

### 3.2.4 Given

I am a Subordinate user viewing a 'Sync Failed' notification for an offline record.

### 3.2.5 When

I tap the 'Retry Sync' button while my device is still offline or has no internet connection.

### 3.2.6 Then



```
The system must not show a prolonged loading state.
AND it must immediately display a clear, user-friendly error message (e.g., 'Sync failed. Please check your internet connection and try again.').
AND the 'Sync Failed' notification for the record must remain visible.
```

### 3.2.7 Validation Notes

Test by enabling airplane mode on the device before tapping the retry button. The app should handle the lack of connectivity gracefully without crashing.

## 3.3.0 Criteria Id

### 3.3.1 Criteria Id

AC-003

### 3.3.2 Scenario

Manual re-sync attempt fails due to a server-side or unexpected error

### 3.3.3 Scenario Type

Error_Condition

### 3.3.4 Given

I am a Subordinate user viewing a 'Sync Failed' notification for an offline record and I have an internet connection.

### 3.3.5 When

I tap the 'Retry Sync' button, but the sync fails due to a server error (e.g., Firestore security rule violation, function error).

### 3.3.6 Then



```
The system must display a user-friendly error message (e.g., 'An error occurred. Please try again later.').
AND the 'Sync Failed' notification for the record must remain visible.
AND the specific technical error must be logged to the remote logging service (e.g., Crashlytics) for troubleshooting.
```

### 3.3.7 Validation Notes

This can be tested by temporarily deploying a restrictive Firestore security rule that would block the write operation, then attempting the sync.

## 3.4.0 Criteria Id

### 3.4.1 Criteria Id

AC-004

### 3.4.2 Scenario

User navigates away while a manual sync is in progress

### 3.4.3 Scenario Type

Edge_Case

### 3.4.4 Given

I have initiated a manual re-sync for a failed record, and the 'Syncing...' indicator is visible.

### 3.4.5 When

I navigate to a different screen in the app or put the app into the background.

### 3.4.6 Then



```
The synchronization process must continue in the background.
AND when I return to the attendance list screen, the UI must accurately reflect the final status of the sync attempt (either successfully synced or failed).
```

### 3.4.7 Validation Notes

Verify that the background sync completes and the UI state is correctly updated upon returning to the foreground.

# 4.0.0 User Interface Requirements

## 4.1.0 Ui Elements

- A clearly labeled 'Retry Sync' or similar call-to-action button, placed within or next to the persistent sync failure notification (defined in US-035).
- A non-blocking loading indicator (e.g., a spinner or progress bar) to provide feedback during the sync attempt.
- Toast messages or snackbars to display success or error messages.

## 4.2.0 User Interactions

- Tapping the 'Retry Sync' button initiates the sync process.
- The 'Retry Sync' button should be disabled while a sync is already in progress to prevent multiple concurrent attempts for the same record.

## 4.3.0 Display Requirements

- The UI must clearly distinguish which specific record(s) have failed to sync.
- Error messages must be user-friendly and avoid technical jargon.

## 4.4.0 Accessibility Needs

- The 'Retry Sync' button must have a proper accessibility label.
- Loading and feedback messages must be announced by screen readers.

# 5.0.0 Business Rules

- {'rule_id': 'BR-SYNC-01', 'rule_description': 'A manual sync can only be triggered for a record that is flagged with a persistent sync failure.', 'enforcement_point': 'Client-side UI logic.', 'violation_handling': "The 'Retry Sync' button will not be visible for records that are not in a failed state."}

# 6.0.0 Dependencies

## 6.1.0 Prerequisite Stories

### 6.1.1 Story Id

#### 6.1.1.1 Story Id

US-033

#### 6.1.1.2 Dependency Reason

This story creates the offline attendance records that might fail to sync.

### 6.1.2.0 Story Id

#### 6.1.2.1 Story Id

US-035

#### 6.1.2.2 Dependency Reason

This story defines the mechanism for detecting and notifying the user of a persistent sync failure, which is the prerequisite for showing the manual retry option.

## 6.2.0.0 Technical Dependencies

- Firebase Firestore SDK for Flutter, specifically its offline persistence and network management capabilities.
- A client-side state management solution (e.g., Riverpod) to handle UI states (loading, error, success).
- A remote logging/crash reporting service (e.g., Firebase Crashlytics) for capturing sync errors.

## 6.3.0.0 Data Dependencies

- Requires access to the locally cached, unsynced attendance records.

## 6.4.0.0 External Dependencies

*No items available*

# 7.0.0.0 Non Functional Requirements

## 7.1.0.0 Performance

- The manual sync process must be asynchronous and not block the UI thread, allowing the user to continue interacting with the app.
- The sync attempt should time out after a reasonable period (e.g., 30 seconds) to prevent an indefinite loading state on a poor connection.

## 7.2.0.0 Security

*No items available*

## 7.3.0.0 Usability

- The process to resolve a sync error must be simple and intuitive for a non-technical user.
- Feedback to the user must be immediate and clear.

## 7.4.0.0 Accessibility

- The feature must comply with WCAG 2.1 Level AA standards.

## 7.5.0.0 Compatibility

- The feature must be fully functional on all supported iOS and Android versions as defined in REQ-DEP-001.

# 8.0.0.0 Implementation Considerations

## 8.1.0.0 Complexity Assessment

Medium

## 8.2.0.0 Complexity Factors

- Requires robust client-side state management to track the sync status of individual records.
- Error handling needs to differentiate between network issues and other failures.
- Ensuring the background sync process is reliable and correctly updates the UI upon app resume adds complexity.

## 8.3.0.0 Technical Risks

- The underlying Firestore SDK's sync behavior can be complex; the manual trigger must work with, not against, the SDK's internal queue.
- Difficulty in reliably simulating various network failure modes for testing.

## 8.4.0.0 Integration Points

- Integrates with the local database/cache where offline records are stored.
- Integrates with the global error logging and reporting service.

# 9.0.0.0 Testing Requirements

- Unit
- Widget
- Integration
- E2E

## 9.2.0.0 Test Scenarios

- Verify successful sync with a good network connection.
- Verify error message when attempting sync with no network connection (airplane mode).
- Verify error message when sync is blocked by a server-side issue (e.g., invalid security rule).
- Verify UI state updates correctly after backgrounding and resuming the app during a sync.
- Verify that only records in a failed state show the 'Retry Sync' option.

## 9.3.0.0 Test Data Needs

- A user account in the 'Subordinate' role.
- A method to create an attendance record locally without it being synced to the server.

## 9.4.0.0 Testing Tools
