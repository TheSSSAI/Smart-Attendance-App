# 4.0.0 User Interface Requirements

## 4.1.0 Ui Elements

- A clearly labeled 'Export to CSV' button with a download icon, placed consistently across all report pages.

## 4.2.0 User Interactions

- On click, the button should provide immediate visual feedback (e.g., loading spinner) to indicate the process has started.
- The export process should not block the user from interacting with other parts of the UI.

## 4.3.0 Display Requirements

- User-friendly error notifications must be displayed in case of failure.

## 4.4.0 Accessibility Needs

- The button must be keyboard accessible (focusable and activatable with Enter/Space).
- The button must have an appropriate ARIA label, like 'Export report data to CSV file'.

# 5.0.0 Business Rules

- {'rule_id': 'BR-001', 'rule_description': "Only users with the 'Admin' role can access and use the export functionality.", 'enforcement_point': 'Both client-side (UI visibility) and server-side (API endpoint/data query).', 'violation_handling': "The export button is not rendered for non-Admin users. Any direct API call from a non-Admin user is rejected with a 'Permission Denied' error."}

# 6.0.0 Dependencies

## 6.1.0 Prerequisite Stories

### 6.1.1 Story Id

#### 6.1.1.1 Story Id

US-059

#### 6.1.1.2 Dependency Reason

Requires the existence of summary reports to export from.

### 6.1.2.0 Story Id

#### 6.1.2.1 Story Id

US-060

#### 6.1.2.2 Dependency Reason

The export function must respect the filtering logic implemented in this story.

### 6.1.3.0 Story Id

#### 6.1.3.1 Story Id

US-061

#### 6.1.3.2 Dependency Reason

Requires the 'Late Arrival / Early Departure Report' to exist.

### 6.1.4.0 Story Id

#### 6.1.4.1 Story Id

US-062

#### 6.1.4.2 Dependency Reason

### 6.1.5.0 Story Id

#### 6.1.5.1 Story Id

US-063

#### 6.1.5.2 Dependency Reason

## 6.2.0.0 Technical Dependencies

- Flutter for Web framework for the Admin dashboard.
- A Dart/Flutter package for client-side CSV generation (e.g., `csv`).
- Firebase Firestore for data retrieval.

## 6.3.0.0 Data Dependencies

- Requires access to the `attendance`, `users`, and `teams` collections in Firestore to build the reports.

## 6.4.0.0 External Dependencies

*No items available*

# 7.0.0.0 Non Functional Requirements

## 7.1.0.0 Performance

- For reports containing up to 1,000 rows, the file download should initiate within 5 seconds of clicking the export button on a standard broadband connection.

## 7.2.0.0 Security

- All data queries for the export must be governed by Firestore Security Rules, ensuring an Admin can only export data from their own tenant.

## 7.3.0.0 Usability

- The export process should be intuitive, requiring only a single click.
- The downloaded filename should be predictable and informative.

## 7.4.0.0 Accessibility

- The feature must comply with WCAG 2.1 Level AA standards.

## 7.5.0.0 Compatibility

- The export functionality must work correctly on the latest stable versions of Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge.

# 8.0.0.0 Implementation Considerations

## 8.1.0.0 Complexity Assessment

Medium

## 8.2.0.0 Complexity Factors

- Developing a reusable export component that can be applied to multiple different reports.
- Ensuring robust handling of various data types and special characters during CSV serialization.
- Implementing non-blocking UI feedback for potentially long-running export operations.

## 8.3.0.0 Technical Risks

- Client-side generation may have performance limitations with extremely large datasets (>10,000 rows), potentially causing browser slowdowns. A future iteration might require a server-side Cloud Function for asynchronous generation.

## 8.4.0.0 Integration Points

- Integrates with the data-fetching logic of each report page.
- Integrates with the browser's file download API.

# 9.0.0.0 Testing Requirements

- Widget
- Integration
- Manual

## 9.2.0.0 Test Scenarios
