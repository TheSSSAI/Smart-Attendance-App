# 3 Acceptance Criteria

## 3.1 Criteria Id

### 3.1.1 Criteria Id

AC-001

### 3.1.2 Scenario

Happy Path: Successful email delivery with a valid link

### 3.1.3 Scenario Type

Happy_Path

### 3.1.4 Given

an Admin has successfully submitted an invitation for a new user with the email 'new.user@example.com'

### 3.1.5 When

the backend system processes the invitation request

### 3.1.6 Then

a unique, cryptographically secure registration token is generated and associated with the user's 'invited' profile in Firestore.

### 3.1.7 And

the email explicitly mentions that the link will expire in 24 hours.

### 3.1.8 Validation Notes

Verify using a test email inbox (e.g., Mailtrap) that the email is received. Check the Firestore document for the 'invited' user to confirm the token and expiry timestamp are stored. The link format should be validated.

## 3.2.0 Criteria Id

### 3.2.1 Criteria Id

AC-002

### 3.2.2 Scenario

Email content and branding

### 3.2.3 Scenario Type

Happy_Path

### 3.2.4 Given

an invited user opens the invitation email

### 3.2.5 When

they view the email content

### 3.2.6 Then

the email template is responsive and renders correctly on both mobile and desktop email clients.

### 3.2.7 And

the email uses professional language and branding consistent with the application.

### 3.2.8 Validation Notes

Test the HTML email template using a service like Litmus or Email on Acid to ensure cross-client compatibility.

## 3.3.0 Criteria Id

### 3.3.1 Criteria Id

AC-003

### 3.3.2 Scenario

Error Condition: Email service provider API fails

### 3.3.3 Scenario Type

Error_Condition

### 3.3.4 Given

the system attempts to send an invitation email

### 3.3.5 When

the SendGrid API is unavailable or returns a server-side error (e.g., 5xx)

### 3.3.6 Then

the system logs the critical error in Cloud Logging with the user ID and error details.

### 3.3.7 And

no email is sent to the user.

### 3.3.8 Validation Notes

In an integration test environment, mock the SendGrid API to return an error and verify that the Cloud Function handles the exception gracefully and updates the Firestore document as expected.

## 3.4.0 Criteria Id

### 3.4.1 Criteria Id

AC-004

### 3.4.2 Scenario

Error Condition: Email hard bounces

### 3.4.3 Scenario Type

Error_Condition

### 3.4.4 Given

an invitation email is sent to a non-existent email address

### 3.4.5 When

the SendGrid service reports a hard bounce event

### 3.4.6 Then

a webhook or monitoring process updates the invited user's profile in Firestore with a status indicating delivery failure (e.g., `invitationStatus: 'delivery_failed'`).

### 3.4.7 And

this status is made visible to the Admin in the user management dashboard.

### 3.4.8 Validation Notes

This requires configuring SendGrid webhooks to post bounce events to a Cloud Function endpoint. Test by sending an invitation to a known bad email address.

# 4.0.0 User Interface Requirements

## 4.1.0 Ui Elements

- Responsive HTML email template
- Clear subject line (e.g., 'You're invited to join [Organization Name] on [App Name]')
- Prominent call-to-action button (e.g., 'Create Your Account')
- Text indicating the link's 24-hour expiration

## 4.2.0 User Interactions

- User receives and opens the email.
- User clicks the registration link/button to proceed to the next step (covered in US-006).

## 4.3.0 Display Requirements

- Inviting organization's name must be displayed.
- Application name/logo must be present for branding.

## 4.4.0 Accessibility Needs

- Email template must use semantic HTML.
- Call-to-action button must have descriptive text.
- Sufficient color contrast must be used in the email design.

# 5.0.0 Business Rules

## 5.1.0 Rule Id

### 5.1.1 Rule Id

BR-001

### 5.1.2 Rule Description

The user invitation link must expire exactly 24 hours after it is generated.

### 5.1.3 Enforcement Point

Backend logic during token validation (covered in US-006).

### 5.1.4 Violation Handling

User is shown an 'Invitation Expired' page and prompted to request a new invitation.

## 5.2.0 Rule Id

### 5.2.1 Rule Id

BR-002

### 5.2.2 Rule Description

The registration token must be unique and single-use.

### 5.2.3 Enforcement Point

Backend logic during token validation and consumption.

### 5.2.4 Violation Handling

Once used, the token is invalidated. Subsequent attempts to use the same link will result in an error page.

# 6.0.0 Dependencies

## 6.1.0 Prerequisite Stories

- {'story_id': 'US-004', 'dependency_reason': 'This story implements the backend process and email delivery that is triggered by the Admin action defined in US-004. The Admin UI to invite a user must exist first.'}

## 6.2.0 Technical Dependencies

- Firebase Cloud Functions for server-side logic.
- Firebase Firestore for storing user state and tokens.
- Firebase Extension for SendGrid (or a custom integration) for sending emails.
- Google Secret Manager for storing the SendGrid API key.
