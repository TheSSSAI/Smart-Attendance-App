# 3 Acceptance Criteria

## 3.1 Criteria Id

### 3.1.1 Criteria Id

AC-001

### 3.1.2 Scenario

Successful registration with unique organization name

### 3.1.3 Scenario Type

Happy_Path

### 3.1.4 Given

A potential administrator is on the registration page and has filled all required fields with valid data, including a globally unique organization name and a password meeting complexity requirements

### 3.1.5 When

The user clicks the 'Register' button

### 3.1.6 Then

A new tenant document is created in Firestore, a new user is created in Firebase Authentication with the 'Admin' role, custom claims for tenantId and role are set on the user's auth token, the user is automatically logged in, and they are redirected to the Admin dashboard.

### 3.1.7 Validation Notes

Verify in Firestore that a new document exists in `/tenants/{tenantId}`. Verify in Firebase Auth that the user exists. Use a token decoder to verify the `tenantId` and `role` custom claims. Confirm the application navigates to the admin dashboard URL.

## 3.2.0 Criteria Id

### 3.2.1 Criteria Id

AC-002

### 3.2.2 Scenario

Registration attempt with a duplicate organization name

### 3.2.3 Scenario Type

Error_Condition

### 3.2.4 Given

An organization with the name 'Global Tech Inc.' already exists in the system

### 3.2.5 When

A new user enters 'Global Tech Inc.' as the organization name and submits the registration form

### 3.2.6 Then

The system prevents form submission and displays an inline error message: 'Organization name is already taken. Please choose another.'

### 3.2.7 Validation Notes

The check for uniqueness must be case-insensitive. The API call should return a specific error code for this condition, which the UI then displays.

## 3.3.0 Criteria Id

### 3.3.1 Criteria Id

AC-003

### 3.3.2 Scenario

Registration attempt with an invalid email format

### 3.3.3 Scenario Type

Error_Condition

### 3.3.4 Given

A user is on the registration page

### 3.3.5 When

The user enters 'jane.doe@company' in the email field and attempts to submit

### 3.3.6 Then

The form submission is blocked, and an inline validation message 'Please enter a valid email address.' is displayed next to the email field.

### 3.3.7 Validation Notes

This should be validated on the client-side before submission to provide immediate feedback.

## 3.4.0 Criteria Id

### 3.4.1 Criteria Id

AC-004

### 3.4.2 Scenario

Registration attempt with a password that does not meet complexity requirements

### 3.4.3 Scenario Type

Error_Condition

### 3.4.4 Given

The password policy requires a minimum of 8 characters, one uppercase, one lowercase, one number, and one special character

### 3.4.5 When

The user enters 'password123' and attempts to submit

### 3.4.6 Then

The form submission is blocked, and an inline message is displayed detailing the unmet password requirements.

### 3.4.7 Validation Notes

Client-side validation should provide real-time feedback as the user types the password.

## 3.5.0 Criteria Id

### 3.5.1 Criteria Id

AC-005

### 3.5.2 Scenario

Registration attempt with required fields left blank

### 3.5.3 Scenario Type

Error_Condition

### 3.5.4 Given

A user is on the registration page

### 3.5.5 When

The user leaves the 'Organization Name' field empty and clicks 'Register'

### 3.5.6 Then

The form is not submitted, and an inline error message 'This field is required.' is displayed next to the empty field.

### 3.5.7 Validation Notes

Verify this for all mandatory fields on the form.

## 3.6.0 Criteria Id

### 3.6.1 Criteria Id

AC-006

### 3.6.2 Scenario

Registration process creates all required data atomically

### 3.6.3 Scenario Type

Edge_Case

### 3.6.4 Given

A user submits a valid registration form

### 3.6.5 When

An unexpected error occurs during the creation of the Firestore user document after the Firebase Auth user has been created

### 3.6.6 Then

The entire transaction is rolled back, the Firebase Auth user is deleted, and no tenant or user documents are left in the database. The user is shown a generic error message like 'Registration failed. Please try again.'

### 3.6.7 Validation Notes

This must be tested by simulating a failure within the backend Cloud Function to ensure no orphaned data is created.

- Inline validation messages appear for invalid email formats and password complexity failures as the user types.
- A loading indicator is displayed on the 'Register' button after submission.

## 4.3.0 Display Requirements

- Clear labels for all input fields.
- Password complexity requirements are displayed near the password field.
- A generic success message is shown briefly before redirecting to the dashboard.

## 4.4.0 Accessibility Needs
