An Admin has successfully configured the Google Sheets export feature

### 3.3.5 When

The scheduled Cloud Function fails because the header row of the target Google Sheet has been modified and no longer matches the expected schema

### 3.3.6 Then

The Cloud Function must update the `linkedSheets` document in Firestore to set its status to 'error' and include a reason code like 'schema_mismatch'.

### 3.3.7 And

The Admin dashboard displays a prominent alert banner stating the sync failed due to an invalid sheet format.

### 3.3.8 Validation Notes

### 3.5.7 Then

The Cloud Function must update the `linkedSheets` document status to 'active' or 'success'.

### 3.5.8 Validation Notes

Perform an end-to-end test: cause a failure, see the alert, fix the issue, trigger a successful sync, and confirm the alert disappears without a page refresh.

# 4.0.0 User Interface Requirements

## 4.1.0 Ui Elements

- A persistent, page-level alert banner component.
- A call-to-action button/link within the banner.
- An icon indicating a warning or error status.
- A dismiss icon ('x') to temporarily hide the banner.

## 4.2.0 User Interactions

- The banner should appear without user action when an error state is present.
- Clicking the call-to-action navigates the user to the integration settings page.
- Clicking the dismiss icon hides the banner for the current session/view, but it reappears on page reload if the error persists.

## 4.3.0 Display Requirements

- The banner must be displayed prominently, typically at the top of the main content area of the Admin dashboard.
- The banner's color scheme should indicate a warning (e.g., yellow or red background).
- The error message displayed should be user-friendly and map to the specific error code (e.g., 'permission_revoked' becomes 'Sync failed: App permissions were revoked.').

## 4.4.0 Accessibility Needs

- The banner must have sufficient color contrast to meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards.
- The banner must be navigable via keyboard and properly announced by screen readers using appropriate ARIA roles (e.g., role='alert').

# 5.0.0 Business Rules

## 5.1.0 Rule Id

### 5.1.1 Rule Id

BR-001

### 5.1.2 Rule Description

An alert for a failed Google Sheets sync must be displayed to all users with the 'Admin' role within the affected tenant.

### 5.1.3 Enforcement Point

Client-side (Admin Web Dashboard) upon loading data.

### 5.1.4 Violation Handling

If an Admin cannot see the alert, it is considered a system bug.

## 5.2.0 Rule Id

### 5.2.1 Rule Id

BR-002

### 5.2.2 Rule Description

The alert state is considered active as long as the sync status field in the `linkedSheets` document is set to 'error'.

### 5.2.3 Enforcement Point

Server-side (Cloud Function) and Client-side (UI rendering logic).

### 5.2.4 Violation Handling

The alert will not display or be removed until the status is updated by a successful sync.

# 6.0.0 Dependencies

## 6.1.0 Prerequisite Stories

### 6.1.1 Story Id

#### 6.1.1.1 Story Id

US-065

#### 6.1.1.2 Dependency Reason

The feature to configure the Google Sheets export must exist before failure alerts can be implemented.

### 6.1.2.0 Story Id

#### 6.1.2.1 Story Id

US-066

#### 6.1.2.2 Dependency Reason

The OAuth authorization flow is a prerequisite for the sync process that can fail.

### 6.1.3.0 Story Id

#### 6.1.3.1 Story Id

US-068

#### 6.1.3.2 Dependency Reason

This story provides the resolution path. The alert's call-to-action must link to the re-authorization/re-linking page built in US-068.

## 6.2.0.0 Technical Dependencies

- Firebase Cloud Function infrastructure for running scheduled jobs.
- Firestore database for storing the integration's status.
- Google Sheets API client library for Node.js.
- Flutter for Web framework for the Admin dashboard UI.

## 6.3.0.0 Data Dependencies

- Requires a Firestore document (e.g., in `/tenants/{tenantId}/linkedSheets/{adminUserId}`) to store the sync status, last error message, and timestamp.

## 6.4.0.0 External Dependencies

- Availability and error response consistency of the Google Sheets API.

# 7.0.0.0 Non Functional Requirements

## 7.1.0.0 Performance

- Checking for the alert status must not add more than 50ms to the Admin dashboard's initial load time.
- The UI must update in real-time via a Firestore stream without requiring a page refresh.

## 7.2.0.0 Security

- The sync status data, which may contain error details, must only be readable by users with the 'Admin' role for that tenant, enforced by Firestore Security Rules.

## 7.3.0.0 Usability

- The alert must be clear, concise, and provide an obvious path to resolution.
- The alert must not block the user from performing other administrative tasks on the dashboard.

## 7.4.0.0 Accessibility

- Must comply with WCAG 2.1 Level AA standards.

## 7.5.0.0 Compatibility

- The alert banner must render correctly on all supported modern web browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).

# 8.0.0.0 Implementation Considerations

## 8.1.0.0 Complexity Assessment

Medium

## 8.2.0.0 Complexity Factors

- Backend: Requires robust error handling in the Cloud Function to correctly parse various error responses from the Google Sheets API and map them to consistent internal error states.
- Frontend: Requires implementing a conditional, persistent UI component that is managed by a real-time data stream from Firestore.
- State Management: The logic for temporary dismissal of the alert on the client-side while respecting the persistent error state from the backend needs careful implementation.

## 8.3.0.0 Technical Risks

- The Google Sheets API may return ambiguous or undocumented error codes, requiring additional logic to handle unexpected failures gracefully.
- A race condition could occur if an Admin attempts to fix the issue while a sync is in progress.

## 8.4.0.0 Integration Points

- Cloud Function <-> Google Sheets API
- Cloud Function <-> Firestore
- Flutter Web Client <-> Firestore

# 9.0.0.0 Testing Requirements

## 9.1.0.0 Testing Types

- Unit
- Integration
- E2E
- Accessibility

## 9.2.0.0 Test Scenarios

- Simulate a 403 Forbidden error from Google API and verify the 'permission_revoked' state is set and displayed.
- Simulate a 404 Not Found error and verify the 'sheet_not_found' state is set and displayed.
- Manually test the full E2E flow: configure, revoke permissions, see alert, re-authorize, see alert disappear.
- Verify the alert is not shown to Supervisor or Subordinate roles.

## 9.3.0.0 Test Data Needs

- A test tenant with an Admin user.
- A dedicated Google account for testing that can have its permissions revoked and restored.
- A sample Google Sheet to act as the sync target.

## 9.4.0.0 Testing Tools

# 11.0.0.0 Planning Information

## 11.1.0.0 Story Points

5

## 11.2.0.0 Priority

🔴 High

## 11.3.0.0 Sprint Considerations

- This story is tightly coupled with US-068 (the resolution flow) and they should be developed and tested together, ideally in the same sprint.
- Requires coordination between backend (Cloud Function) and frontend (Flutter Web) development.

## 11.4.0.0 Release Impact

Critical for the reliability of the Google Sheets integration feature. Without this, the feature is not production-ready due to the risk of silent failures.
