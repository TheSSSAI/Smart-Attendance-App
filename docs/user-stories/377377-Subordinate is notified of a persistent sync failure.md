the device regains connectivity and the Firestore SDK successfully syncs the data in the background before the app is opened

### 3.5.6 When

the user opens the application

### 3.5.7 Then

the persistent sync failure notification is not displayed.

### 3.5.8 Validation Notes

Simulate a stale record, enable network to allow background sync, then open the app. The banner should not be present.

# 4.0.0 User Interface Requirements

## 4.1.0 Ui Elements

- A persistent banner component displayed across the top of the main application screens.
- A 'Retry Sync' or similarly labeled button within the banner.
- A temporary feedback mechanism (e.g., Snackbar/Toast) for success and error messages.

## 4.2.0 User Interactions

- The banner must remain visible and cannot be dismissed by swiping.
- Tapping the 'Retry Sync' button must trigger the synchronization logic.
- The banner should not block interaction with the rest of the screen content.

## 4.3.0 Display Requirements

- The banner must use a high-contrast color scheme (e.g., yellow or red background) to draw attention.
- The text must be clear, concise, and non-technical.

## 4.4.0 Accessibility Needs

- The banner and its contents must be accessible to screen readers.
- Color contrast must meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards.

# 5.0.0 Business Rules

- {'rule_id': 'BR-SYNC-01', 'rule_description': "An offline record is considered 'stale' and requires user notification if it has not been successfully synced to the server within a 24-hour period of its creation.", 'enforcement_point': 'Client-side logic on application startup or when brought to the foreground.', 'violation_handling': 'Display the persistent in-app sync failure notification.'}

# 6.0.0 Dependencies

## 6.1.0 Prerequisite Stories

- {'story_id': 'US-033', 'dependency_reason': 'This story depends on the core functionality of creating and storing attendance records locally while the device is offline. The mechanism to create offline data must exist before a notification for its sync failure can be built.'}

## 6.2.0 Technical Dependencies

- A local persistence mechanism to track the creation timestamp of pending offline writes (e.g., a separate table in a local `drift` database that complements Firestore's offline cache).
- A global state management solution (Riverpod) to manage the visibility of the persistent notification banner across different app screens.

## 6.3.0 Data Dependencies

- Requires access to the local queue of unsynced Firestore documents and their creation timestamps.

## 6.4.0 External Dependencies

*No items available*

# 7.0.0 Non Functional Requirements

## 7.1.0 Performance

- The check for stale offline records on app startup must complete in under 200ms to avoid negatively impacting the user's perception of app launch speed.

## 7.2.0 Security

- The retry mechanism must follow the same authentication and security rules as any other data submission to Firestore.

## 7.3.0 Usability

- The notification must be clear and provide an obvious path to resolution for a non-technical user.

## 7.4.0 Accessibility

- The notification must adhere to the application's overall WCAG 2.1 Level AA accessibility standards.

## 7.5.0 Compatibility

- The offline data tracking and notification logic must function consistently on all supported iOS and Android versions.

# 8.0.0 Implementation Considerations

## 8.1.0 Complexity Assessment

Medium

## 8.2.0 Complexity Factors

- Reliably tracking the age of pending writes in Firestore's offline queue can be complex. An auxiliary local database (like `drift`) is recommended to store metadata about pending writes, including their initial timestamp.
- Managing the global state of the notification banner to ensure it appears and disappears correctly across the entire app.
- Implementing a robust E2E testing strategy that involves manipulating device connectivity and time.

## 8.3.0 Technical Risks

- The Firestore SDK's offline queue is largely a black box. Relying solely on it without an auxiliary tracking mechanism may make it difficult to identify which specific writes are stale.
- Incorrectly managing the lifecycle of the check could lead to performance degradation or battery drain.

## 8.4.0 Integration Points

- Integrates with the local database (`drift` or similar).
- Integrates with the global state management (Riverpod).
- Integrates with the core Firestore data writing service.

# 9.0.0 Testing Requirements

## 9.1.0 Testing Types

- Unit
- Widget
- Integration
- E2E

## 9.2.0 Test Scenarios

- Simulate an offline record creation, advance time, and verify the banner appears on app launch.
- With the banner visible, enable the network and test the successful retry flow.
- With the banner visible, keep the network disabled and test the failed retry flow.
- Test with multiple stale records to ensure the count is correct.
- Test the background sync resolution scenario where the banner should not appear.

## 9.3.0 Test Data Needs

- A test user account (Subordinate role).
- Ability to create attendance records that can be flagged as 'offline'.

## 9.4.0 Testing Tools

- `flutter_test` for unit and widget tests.
- `integration_test` for E2E tests.
- A method to control device network connectivity during tests.
- A method to manipulate device time or record timestamps for testing the 24-hour rule.

# 10.0.0 Definition Of Done

- All acceptance criteria validated and passing
- Code reviewed and approved by at least one other developer
- Unit and widget tests implemented with >80% coverage for the new logic
- E2E integration test for the full offline-notify-retry cycle is implemented and passing
- User interface reviewed and approved by the design team
- Performance impact on app startup has been measured and is within acceptable limits
- Accessibility of the new UI components has been verified
- Documentation for the offline sync failure handling mechanism is updated
- Story deployed and verified in the staging environment

# 11.0.0 Planning Information

## 11.1.0 Story Points

5

## 11.2.0 Priority

ðŸ”´ High

## 11.3.0 Sprint Considerations

- This story has a hard dependency on US-033. It cannot be started until the basic offline functionality is complete.
- Requires significant testing effort, including manual and automated E2E tests, which should be accounted for in sprint capacity.

## 11.4.0 Release Impact

This is a critical reliability feature. Its inclusion significantly improves the robustness of the offline functionality and is highly recommended for any release that includes offline capabilities.
