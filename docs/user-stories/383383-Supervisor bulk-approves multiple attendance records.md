# 3 Acceptance Criteria

## 3.1 Criteria Id

### 3.1.1 Criteria Id

AC-001

### 3.1.5 When

The Supervisor selects three pending records using their respective checkboxes and clicks the 'Approve Selected' button

### 3.1.6 Then

The system initiates a batch update operation, showing a loading indicator in the UI.

### 3.1.7 And

A success notification (e.g., '3 records approved successfully') is displayed to the Supervisor.

### 3.2.6 Then

The 'Approve Selected' button becomes enabled.

### 3.2.7 And

A counter accurately displays the number of selected records (e.g., '3 selected').

### 3.2.8 Validation Notes

### 3.4.5 When

The Supervisor clicks 'Approve Selected' and the backend operation fails for any reason (e.g., loss of permission, database error)

### 3.4.6 Then

The entire batch operation is rolled back, and no records have their status changed.

### 3.4.7 And

All selected records remain in the 'Pending Approvals' list with their 'pending' status.

### 3.4.8 Validation Notes

AC-005

### 3.5.2 Scenario

Security check for record ownership

### 3.5.3 Scenario Type

Error_Condition

A user attempts to call the bulk-approval function with a list of record IDs

### 3.5.5 When

The list contains at least one record that does not belong to a direct subordinate of the calling Supervisor

### 3.5.6 Then

The entire operation is rejected by the backend.

### 3.5.7 And

An error is logged, and a generic failure message is returned to the client.

### 3.5.8 Validation Notes

This must be tested at the Cloud Function level. Attempt to approve a record belonging to another supervisor's team.

# 4.0.0 User Interface Requirements

## 4.1.0 Ui Elements

- Checkbox next to each pending attendance record.
- A 'Select All' checkbox in the header of the record list.
- An 'Approve Selected' button, which is contextually enabled/disabled.
- A text element displaying the count of selected records.
- A loading indicator (e.g., spinner) to show during the operation.
- A temporary notification/toast/snackbar for success or error feedback.

## 4.2.0 User Interactions

- User can tap a checkbox to select/deselect a single record.
- User can tap 'Select All' to select/deselect all visible records.
- User taps the 'Approve Selected' button to initiate the bulk action.

## 4.3.0 Display Requirements

- The list of pending records must be clearly presented.
- The number of selected items must be visible to the user.

## 4.4.0 Accessibility Needs

- All checkboxes and buttons must have appropriate labels for screen readers.
- The selected state of a record must be programmatically determinable and visually distinct.
- Sufficient color contrast for all UI elements.

# 5.0.0 Business Rules

## 5.1.0 Rule Id

### 5.1.1 Rule Id

BR-001

### 5.1.2 Rule Description

A Supervisor can only bulk-approve records that are in a 'pending' status.

### 5.1.3 Enforcement Point

Backend (Cloud Function) and Frontend (UI should only display pending records for selection).

### 5.1.4 Violation Handling

The backend operation will reject any records not in 'pending' status. The UI will not present non-pending records as options for this action.

## 5.2.0 Rule Id

### 5.2.1 Rule Id

BR-002

### 5.2.2 Rule Description

A Supervisor can only bulk-approve records belonging to their direct subordinates.

### 5.2.3 Enforcement Point

Backend (Cloud Function) during permission validation.

### 5.2.4 Violation Handling

The entire batch operation is rejected if any record fails the ownership check. An error is logged.

# 6.0.0 Dependencies

## 6.1.0 Prerequisite Stories

### 6.1.1 Story Id

#### 6.1.1.1 Story Id

US-037

#### 6.1.1.2 Dependency Reason

This story adds bulk actions to the pending approvals list, which must be implemented first.

### 6.1.2.0 Story Id

#### 6.1.2.1 Story Id

US-039

#### 6.1.2.2 Dependency Reason

The core logic and permissions for a single record approval must exist before it can be extended to a bulk operation.

## 6.2.0.0 Technical Dependencies

- Firebase Authentication for user role and ID verification.
- Firebase Firestore for data storage and retrieval.
- A callable Firebase Cloud Function to handle the backend logic securely and atomically.

## 6.3.0.0 Data Dependencies

- Requires access to the `attendance` collection.
- Requires `supervisorId` and `status` fields to be present on attendance records.

## 6.4.0.0 External Dependencies

*No items available*

# 7.0.0.0 Non Functional Requirements

## 7.1.0.0 Performance

- The bulk approval of up to 50 records should complete and reflect in the UI within 3 seconds on a stable 4G connection.
- The UI should remain responsive while the background operation is in progress.

## 7.2.0.0 Security

- The entire operation must be performed via a backend function (e.g., callable Cloud Function) that validates the user's role and permissions for every record in the batch.
- Client-side logic must not be trusted to perform the database updates directly.

## 7.3.0.0 Usability

- The process of selecting and approving multiple records should be intuitive and require minimal steps.
- Clear feedback must be provided to the user at every stage (selection, processing, completion).

## 7.4.0.0 Accessibility

- The feature must comply with WCAG 2.1 Level AA standards.

## 7.5.0.0 Compatibility

- The feature must function correctly on all supported iOS and Android versions as defined in REQ-DEP-001.

# 8.0.0.0 Implementation Considerations

## 8.1.0.0 Complexity Assessment

Medium

## 8.2.0.0 Complexity Factors

- Requires both frontend state management for the selection UI and a new backend Cloud Function.
- The backend function must use a Firestore Batched Write to ensure atomicity.
- Requires robust error handling for partial or full batch failures.
- Security validation for every record in the batch adds complexity to the backend logic.

## 8.3.0.0 Technical Risks

- Potential for race conditions if a record's state is changed by another process while the bulk operation is being prepared.
- Exceeding Firestore's 500-document limit for a single batch write if the UI allows for very large selections. The UI should probably limit selection to a reasonable number (e.g., 100) or the backend must handle chunking.

## 8.4.0.0 Integration Points

- Flutter Client UI <-> Firebase Cloud Function
- Firebase Cloud Function <-> Firestore Database

# 9.0.0.0 Testing Requirements

## 9.1.0.0 Testing Types

- Unit
- Integration
- E2E
- Security

## 9.2.0.0 Test Scenarios

- Test successful approval of 1, 10, and 50 records.
- Test UI state changes (button disabled/enabled, counter updates).
- Test 'Select All' / 'Deselect All' functionality.
- Test backend rejection when a record ID does not belong to the supervisor's team.
- Test system behavior during a simulated network failure after clicking 'Approve Selected'.
- Test the atomicity of the transaction by forcing a failure on one record in a batch.

## 9.3.0.0 Test Data Needs

- A Supervisor user account.
- Multiple Subordinate user accounts assigned to the Supervisor.
- A set of at least 20 attendance records in 'pending' status for the subordinates.

## 9.4.0.0 Testing Tools
