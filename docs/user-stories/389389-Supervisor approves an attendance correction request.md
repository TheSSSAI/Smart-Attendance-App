# 3 Acceptance Criteria

## 3.1 Criteria Id

### 3.1.1 Criteria Id

AC-001

### 3.1.2 Scenario

Happy Path: Supervisor successfully approves a correction request

### 3.1.3 Scenario Type

Happy_Path

### 3.1.4 Given

A Supervisor is logged in and viewing their dashboard which lists a pending attendance correction request from a direct subordinate with a status of 'correction_pending'

### 3.1.5 When

The Supervisor clicks the 'Approve' button for that specific request

### 3.1.6 Then

The system executes an atomic transaction where the attendance record's status is updated to 'approved', the 'checkInTime' and/or 'checkOutTime' are updated with the corrected values, and a 'manually-corrected' flag is added to the record's flags array.

### 3.1.7 And

A success notification (e.g., toast message) is displayed to the Supervisor.

### 3.1.8 Validation Notes

Verify in Firestore that the attendance record is updated correctly (status, timestamps, flag). Verify the new document in the 'auditLog' collection contains all required fields. Verify the UI removes the item from the pending list.

## 3.2.0 Criteria Id

### 3.2.1 Criteria Id

AC-002

### 3.2.2 Scenario

Audit Log Integrity: The approval action is logged correctly

### 3.2.3 Scenario Type

Happy_Path

### 3.2.4 Given

A Supervisor is about to approve a correction request for an attendance record

### 3.2.5 When

The approval is successfully processed

### 3.2.6 Then

A new document is created in the 'auditLog' collection with 'actionType': 'CorrectionApproved', 'actorUserId': the Supervisor's ID, 'targetEntityId': the attendance record's ID, and a 'details' map containing 'oldValue', 'newValue', and 'justification'.

### 3.2.7 Validation Notes

Query the 'auditLog' collection for the new entry and validate its schema and content against the requirements in REQ-FUN-014.

## 3.3.0 Criteria Id

### 3.3.1 Criteria Id

AC-003

### 3.3.2 Scenario

Error Condition: Approval fails due to network error

### 3.3.3 Scenario Type

Error_Condition

### 3.3.4 Given

A Supervisor clicks the 'Approve' button for a correction request

### 3.3.5 When

The client application fails to communicate with the backend due to a network issue

### 3.3.6 Then

The system does not change the state of the attendance record or create an audit log entry.

### 3.3.7 And

The request remains in the Supervisor's pending list.

### 3.3.8 Validation Notes

Use network throttling tools to simulate a connection failure. Verify that no data changes occur in Firestore and that the UI shows the correct error message.

## 3.4.0 Criteria Id

### 3.4.1 Criteria Id

AC-004

### 3.4.2 Scenario

Edge Case: Attempting to approve a stale or already processed request

### 3.4.3 Scenario Type

Edge_Case

### 3.4.4 Given

A Supervisor is viewing a 'correction_pending' request on their screen

### 3.4.5 And

The Supervisor is shown an informative error message (e.g., 'This request has already been processed or is no longer valid.').

### 3.4.6 When

The Supervisor clicks the 'Approve' button

### 3.4.7 Then

The backend function validates the record's current status and detects it is no longer 'correction_pending'.

### 3.4.8 Validation Notes

Manually change a record's status in Firestore while it is loaded in the Supervisor's UI. Trigger the approve action and verify the expected error message and that no data was altered.

# 4.0.0 User Interface Requirements

## 4.1.0 Ui Elements

- An 'Approve' button associated with each pending correction request item.
- A loading indicator (e.g., spinner) that appears after the 'Approve' button is clicked.
- A success message (e.g., toast or snackbar) for successful approvals.
- An error message display for failed approvals.

## 4.2.0 User Interactions

- Tapping the 'Approve' button initiates the approval process.
- The UI should provide immediate feedback that the action is in progress.
- Upon completion (success or failure), the pending request item should be removed from the list (on success) and a status message should be shown.

## 4.3.0 Display Requirements

- The list of pending correction requests must be dynamically updated after an approval action.

## 4.4.0 Accessibility Needs

- The 'Approve' button must have an accessible label like 'Approve correction request for [User Name] on [Date]' for screen readers.

# 5.0.0 Business Rules

## 5.1.0 Rule Id

### 5.1.1 Rule Id

BR-AC-01

### 5.1.2 Rule Description

A Supervisor can only approve correction requests for their direct subordinates.

### 5.1.3 Enforcement Point

Backend (Cloud Function) and Firestore Security Rules.

### 5.1.4 Violation Handling

The request is rejected with a 'permission-denied' error.

## 5.2.0 Rule Id

### 5.2.1 Rule Id

BR-AC-02

### 5.2.2 Rule Description

The approval action must be atomic; the attendance record update and the audit log creation must both succeed or both fail.

### 5.2.3 Enforcement Point

Backend (Cloud Function using Firestore Transaction or Batched Write).

### 5.2.4 Violation Handling

The entire operation is rolled back, and an error is returned to the client.

# 6.0.0 Dependencies

## 6.1.0 Prerequisite Stories

### 6.1.1 Story Id

#### 6.1.1.1 Story Id

US-045

#### 6.1.1.2 Dependency Reason

A correction request must be created by a subordinate before it can be approved.

### 6.1.2.0 Story Id

#### 6.1.2.1 Story Id

US-046

#### 6.1.2.2 Dependency Reason

The UI for a Supervisor to view the details of a correction request must exist to place the 'Approve' button.

### 6.1.3.0 Story Id

#### 6.1.3.1 Story Id
