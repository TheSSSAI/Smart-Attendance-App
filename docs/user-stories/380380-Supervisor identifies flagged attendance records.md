# 4.0.0 User Interface Requirements

## 4.1.0 Ui Elements

- Icon or Chip/Badge component for each flag type ('isOfflineEntry', 'clock_discrepancy', 'auto-checked-out', 'manually-corrected').
- Tooltip or Popover component to display flag descriptions on interaction.

## 4.2.0 User Interactions

- On mobile, a tap on an indicator should reveal its description.
- On the web dashboard, a hover over an indicator should reveal its description.

## 4.3.0 Display Requirements

- Indicators must be placed consistently within each item in the attendance list.
- The UI must gracefully handle up to 3-4 indicators per record without breaking the layout.
- Flag descriptions in tooltips should be concise and easy to understand.

## 4.4.0 Accessibility Needs

- Indicators must not rely on color alone to convey information. Use distinct icons or text labels.
- All indicators and their corresponding tooltips must have proper labels for screen readers (e.g., `semanticLabel` in Flutter).

# 5.0.0 Business Rules

- {'rule_id': 'BR-001', 'rule_description': "A visual indicator must be shown for each string present in the 'flags' array of an attendance record document.", 'enforcement_point': "Client-side rendering of the Supervisor's attendance list.", 'violation_handling': 'If a flag string exists in the data but has no corresponding UI indicator defined, it should be ignored gracefully without causing a client-side error.'}

# 6.0.0 Dependencies

## 6.1.0 Prerequisite Stories

### 6.1.1 Story Id

#### 6.1.1.1 Story Id

US-037

#### 6.1.1.2 Dependency Reason

The Supervisor's dashboard for viewing pending attendance records must exist before indicators can be added to it.

### 6.1.2.0 Story Id

#### 6.1.2.1 Story Id

US-033

#### 6.1.2.2 Dependency Reason

The functionality to capture offline attendance and set the 'isOfflineEntry' flag must be implemented first.

### 6.1.3.0 Story Id

#### 6.1.3.1 Story Id

US-032

#### 6.1.3.2 Dependency Reason

The auto-checkout functionality that sets the 'auto-checked-out' flag must be implemented first.

## 6.2.0.0 Technical Dependencies

- Firebase Firestore SDK for fetching attendance records.
- The attendance data model in Firestore must contain a 'flags' field, which is an array of strings, as per REQ-DAT-001.

## 6.3.0.0 Data Dependencies

- Requires access to attendance records with various combinations of flags for testing purposes.

## 6.4.0.0 External Dependencies

*No items available*

# 7.0.0.0 Non Functional Requirements

## 7.1.0.0 Performance

- Rendering the flag indicators should not add more than 50ms to the paint time of the attendance list view.
- The logic for checking flags should be efficient and not impact the scroll performance of the list.

## 7.2.0.0 Security

- The flags are informational. Access is governed by the Supervisor's role, which is already enforced by Firestore Security Rules for the parent attendance record.

## 7.3.0.0 Usability

- The meaning of each indicator icon/chip should be intuitive or immediately discoverable via the hover/tap interaction.

## 7.4.0.0 Accessibility

- The feature must comply with WCAG 2.1 Level AA standards, particularly regarding color contrast and screen reader support.

## 7.5.0.0 Compatibility

- The visual indicators and their interactions must function correctly on all supported iOS/Android versions and web browsers as defined in REQ-DEP-001.

# 8.0.0.0 Implementation Considerations

## 8.1.0.0 Complexity Assessment

Low

## 8.2.0.0 Complexity Factors

- This is primarily a front-end UI task.
- It relies on pre-existing data fields.
- No backend logic changes are required.
- The main effort is in creating a reusable, scalable UI component for displaying the flags.

## 8.3.0.0 Technical Risks

- The UI for displaying multiple flags could become cluttered if not designed carefully. A maximum number of visible flags might need to be considered, with a '+N more' indicator.
- Ensuring consistent tooltip/popover behavior across mobile and web platforms.

## 8.4.0.0 Integration Points

- Integrates with the data fetched from the Firestore `/attendance` collection.

# 9.0.0.0 Testing Requirements

## 9.1.0.0 Testing Types

- Unit
- Widget
- Integration
- Accessibility

## 9.2.0.0 Test Scenarios

- A record with zero flags.
- A record with exactly one of each possible flag type.
- A record with a combination of two or more flags.
- Tapping/hovering on each indicator to verify the correct description text appears.
- Screen reader correctly announces the flags on a list item.

## 9.3.0.0 Test Data Needs

- A Supervisor user account.
- Multiple Subordinate user accounts under that Supervisor.
- Attendance records for subordinates with various combinations of flags: 'isOfflineEntry', 'clock_discrepancy', 'auto-checked-out', 'manually-corrected', and no flags.

## 9.4.0.0 Testing Tools

- Flutter's `flutter_test` for unit and widget tests.
- Firebase Local Emulator Suite to create test data without affecting production.
- TalkBack (Android) and VoiceOver (iOS) for accessibility testing.

# 10.0.0.0 Definition Of Done

- Code reviewed and approved by at least one other developer
- Unit and widget tests implemented for the flag display logic, achieving >80% code coverage
- Integration testing completed successfully in a staging environment
- User interface reviewed and approved by the Product Owner/Designer
- Accessibility requirements validated with screen readers and contrast checkers
