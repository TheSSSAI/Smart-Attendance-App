# 4.0.0 User Interface Requirements

## 4.1.0 Ui Elements

- Text input field for 'Organization Name'.
- Inline space for a loading indicator, success icon, or error icon.
- Text area below the input field for displaying validation messages.
- A primary 'Register' or 'Submit' button.

## 4.2.0 User Interactions

- Validation is triggered automatically when the 'Organization Name' field loses focus (onBlur).
- The 'Register' button's enabled/disabled state is dynamically controlled by the validity of the form, including the organization name.
- Visual feedback (color, icons, text) is provided immediately after the validation check completes.

## 4.3.0 Display Requirements

- Error messages must be clear, concise, and user-friendly.
- The UI must clearly distinguish between loading, success, and error states for the input field.

## 4.4.0 Accessibility Needs

- Error messages must be programmatically associated with the input field for screen readers (e.g., using `aria-describedby`).
- Color should not be the only means of conveying information (e.g., use icons alongside color changes).

# 5.0.0 Business Rules

- {'rule_id': 'BR-001', 'rule_description': 'Organization names must be globally unique across all tenants, checked in a case-insensitive manner.', 'enforcement_point': 'During the tenant registration process, before a new tenant document is created.', 'violation_handling': 'The system prevents form submission and provides immediate user feedback to correct the name.'}

# 6.0.0 Dependencies

## 6.1.0 Prerequisite Stories

- {'story_id': 'US-001', 'dependency_reason': 'This story implements a validation step within the overall registration flow defined in US-001. The registration page and backend endpoint for tenant creation must exist or be developed concurrently.'}

## 6.2.0 Technical Dependencies

- A backend service (e.g., Firebase Cloud Function) to handle the uniqueness check against the database.
- Defined Firestore data model for tenants (`/tenants/{tenantId}`).

## 6.3.0 Data Dependencies

- Real-time access to the list of existing organization names in the Firestore database.

## 6.4.0 External Dependencies

*No items available*

# 7.0.0 Non Functional Requirements

## 7.1.0 Performance

- The p95 latency for the server-side validation check must be under 300ms to provide a near-instantaneous user experience.

## 7.2.0 Security

- The validation endpoint must be callable by unauthenticated users but must be protected against enumeration attacks (scraping of organization names) via rate limiting and/or Firebase App Check.
- The endpoint response should only be a boolean (true/false) indicating availability, not any other tenant data.

## 7.3.0 Usability

- Feedback must be immediate and unambiguous to prevent user confusion.

## 7.4.0 Accessibility

- The feature must comply with WCAG 2.1 Level AA standards.

## 7.5.0 Compatibility

- The registration form and its validation logic must function correctly on all supported web browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).

# 8.0.0 Implementation Considerations

## 8.1.0 Complexity Assessment

Medium

## 8.2.0 Complexity Factors

- Requires both frontend (Flutter for Web) and backend (Cloud Function) development.
- Implementing an efficient, scalable database query for the uniqueness check. A separate collection for normalized names (e.g., `/organizationNames/{normalizedName}`) is recommended over querying the main tenants collection.
- Securing the public-facing validation endpoint.
- Managing asynchronous state (loading, success, error) on the client-side.

## 8.3.0 Technical Risks

- A naive database query could become a performance bottleneck as the number of tenants grows.
- The public endpoint could be a target for abuse if not properly secured with rate limiting and App Check.

## 8.4.0 Integration Points

- The frontend registration form must call the backend validation Cloud Function.
- The Cloud Function must read from the Firestore `tenants` collection (or a dedicated index collection).

# 9.0.0 Testing Requirements

## 9.1.0 Testing Types

- Unit
- Integration
- E2E

## 9.2.0 Test Scenarios

- Registering with a unique name.
- Attempting to register with an existing name (case-insensitive).
- Attempting to register with an empty/whitespace name.
- UI behavior during network latency and network failure.
- Correcting an invalid name and successfully proceeding.

## 9.3.0 Test Data Needs

- A pre-populated test database with a set of existing organization names to test duplicate scenarios.

## 9.4.0 Testing Tools

- Firebase Local Emulator Suite for local development and integration testing.
- Flutter's `flutter_test` for widget tests.
- Jest for Cloud Function unit tests.

# 10.0.0 Definition Of Done

- All acceptance criteria validated and passing
- Code reviewed and approved by team
- Unit tests implemented for both frontend and backend logic with >80% coverage
- Integration testing between the client and Cloud Function completed successfully
- User interface reviewed and approved by the Product Owner/UX designer
- Performance requirements for the validation endpoint are verified
- Security requirements (rate limiting, App Check) are implemented and validated
- Documentation for the validation Cloud Function is created
- Story deployed and verified in the staging environment

# 11.0.0 Planning Information

## 11.1.0 Story Points

3

## 11.2.0 Priority

ðŸ”´ High

## 11.3.0 Sprint Considerations

- This story is a blocker for the completion of the main registration feature (US-001) and should be prioritized and planned in the same sprint.

## 11.4.0 Release Impact

This is a critical feature for the initial public release (MVP) as it's part of the core user onboarding flow.
