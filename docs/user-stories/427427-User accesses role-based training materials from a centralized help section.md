# 4.0.0 User Interface Requirements

## 4.1.0 Ui Elements

- A 'Help & Training' menu item in the main navigation drawer or settings screen.
- A list view to display training materials.
- List items should include an icon (e.g., document for PDF, play for video), a title, and an optional short description.
- Headers to group materials by role (e.g., 'For Supervisors', 'For Subordinates').

## 4.2.0 User Interactions

- Tapping the 'Help & Training' menu item navigates the user to the materials screen.
- Tapping a list item initiates the action to view the content (open PDF or launch video URL).
- The screen should be scrollable if the list of materials exceeds the viewport height.

## 4.3.0 Display Requirements

- The title of each training material must be clearly displayed.
- The type of material (e.g., Guide, Video) should be visually indicated.

## 4.4.0 Accessibility Needs

- All interactive elements (links to materials) must have descriptive labels for screen readers, compliant with WCAG 2.1 Level AA.
- Sufficient color contrast must be used for text and icons.

# 5.0.0 Business Rules

- {'rule_id': 'BR-001', 'rule_description': "Content visibility is strictly determined by the user's assigned role. Supervisors can view their own content plus the content of roles they manage (Subordinates). Admins can view all content.", 'enforcement_point': 'Client-side, when fetching and displaying the list of training materials.', 'violation_handling': 'Content for unauthorized roles is not fetched or rendered in the UI.'}

# 6.0.0 Dependencies

## 6.1.0 Prerequisite Stories

- {'story_id': 'US-021', 'dependency_reason': "The system must be able to reliably identify the logged-in user's role to filter and display the correct training materials."}

## 6.2.0 Technical Dependencies

- A data store (e.g., Firestore collection) to hold metadata for training materials (title, URL, type, target roles).
- Flutter package for launching URLs (e.g., `url_launcher`).
- Flutter package for displaying PDFs (e.g., `flutter_pdfview` or similar).

## 6.3.0 Data Dependencies

- The training materials (PDFs, videos) must be created and hosted at stable, publicly accessible URLs. PDFs can be hosted in Firebase Storage.

## 6.4.0 External Dependencies

- Availability of the external hosting services (e.g., Firebase Storage, YouTube) where the training materials are stored.

# 7.0.0 Non Functional Requirements

## 7.1.0 Performance

- The list of training materials should load in under 2 seconds on a stable 4G connection.

## 7.2.0 Security

- All URLs for training materials must use HTTPS.
- The data source for the materials list should be read-only for all user roles to prevent client-side manipulation.

## 7.3.0 Usability

- The 'Help & Training' section should be easily discoverable within the application's primary navigation.
- The process of finding and opening a guide should be intuitive and require minimal taps.

## 7.4.0 Accessibility

- The feature must comply with WCAG 2.1 Level AA standards as per REQ-INT-001.

## 7.5.0 Compatibility

- The feature must function correctly on all supported iOS and Android versions (iOS 12.0+, Android 6.0+).
- The feature must function correctly on the web dashboard for the Admin role.

# 8.0.0 Implementation Considerations

## 8.1.0 Complexity Assessment

Low

## 8.2.0 Complexity Factors

- UI is a simple list view.
- Backend logic involves a straightforward Firestore query based on the user's role.
- Integration with standard, well-documented third-party packages for viewing content.

## 8.3.0 Technical Risks

- The selected PDF viewer package may have performance or rendering issues with large files or on older devices; this requires testing.
- Content management is out of scope for this story but is a critical dependency. A process for updating links must be established.

## 8.4.0 Integration Points

- Firebase Authentication (to get user role).
- Firestore (to fetch the list of materials).
- Device OS (for launching URLs and potentially viewing PDFs).

# 9.0.0 Testing Requirements

## 9.1.0 Testing Types

- Unit
- Widget
- Integration
- E2E
- Accessibility

## 9.2.0 Test Scenarios

- Log in as each user role (Admin, Supervisor, Subordinate) and verify the correct list of materials is displayed.
- Successfully open a PDF and a video link.
- Verify the offline error message is displayed correctly.
- Verify the 'no materials' message is displayed when the data source is empty for a given role.
- Test with a broken URL to ensure the app handles the error gracefully.

## 9.3.0 Test Data Needs

- Test accounts for Admin, Supervisor, and Subordinate roles.
- A populated Firestore collection with training material metadata, including items for each role and type (PDF/Video).
- At least one valid, hosted PDF and one valid, hosted video for testing.
- At least one broken URL for error handling tests.

## 9.4.0 Testing Tools

- Flutter Test framework for unit/widget tests.
- Firebase Local Emulator Suite.
- Device screen readers (TalkBack/VoiceOver) for accessibility testing.

# 10.0.0 Definition Of Done

- All acceptance criteria validated and passing on both mobile platforms and the web dashboard.
- Code reviewed and approved by team, adhering to style guides.
- Unit and widget tests implemented with >80% coverage for new logic.
- Integration testing completed successfully for opening PDFs and videos.
- User interface reviewed and approved by the product owner/designer.
- Accessibility requirements validated via manual testing with screen readers.
- Documentation for managing the training materials list in Firestore is created.
- Story deployed and verified in the staging environment.

# 11.0.0 Planning Information

## 11.1.0 Story Points

3

## 11.2.0 Priority

🟡 Medium

## 11.3.0 Sprint Considerations

- The creation and hosting of the actual training materials (PDFs/videos) is a dependency that must be coordinated. Development can proceed with placeholder links.

## 11.4.0 Release Impact

This feature enhances the new user experience and can be included in any release after the core login/role functionality is stable. It is a key component of the v1.0 user support strategy.
