# 3 Acceptance Criteria

## 3.1 Criteria Id

### 3.1.1 Criteria Id

AC-001

### 3.1.2 Scenario

### 3.1.3 Scenario Type

Happy_Path

### 3.1.4 Given

A Supervisor is on the 'Create Event' screen and has at least two direct subordinates

### 3.1.5 When

The Supervisor navigates to the user assignment section, selects two specific subordinates from the list, and saves the event

### 3.1.6 Then

A new event document is created in the Firestore 'events' collection, and its 'assignedUserIds' array field contains the unique IDs of the two selected subordinates.

### 3.1.7 Validation Notes

AC-002

### 3.2.2 Scenario

Supervisor modifies assignments on an existing event

### 3.2.3 Scenario Type

Happy_Path

### 3.2.4 Given

A Supervisor is editing an event that is already assigned to 'Subordinate A'

### 3.2.5 When

The Supervisor deselects 'Subordinate A', selects 'Subordinate B', and saves the changes

### 3.2.6 Then

The event document in Firestore is updated, and the 'assignedUserIds' array now contains only the user ID of 'Subordinate B'.

### 3.2.7 Validation Notes

Inspect the updated event document in Firestore. The 'assignedUserIds' array must have a size of 1 and contain the ID for 'Subordinate B'.

## 3.3.0 Criteria Id

AC-003

### 3.3.2 Scenario

Supervisor unassigns all individuals from an event

### 3.3.3 Scenario Type

Alternative_Flow

### 3.3.4 Given

A Supervisor is editing an event that is assigned to one or more subordinates

### 3.3.5 When

The Supervisor deselects all individuals and saves the event

### 3.3.6 Then

The 'assignedUserIds' array in the event document is updated to be empty.

### 3.3.7 Validation Notes

Check the Firestore event document to confirm the 'assignedUserIds' field is an empty array.

## 3.4.0 Criteria Id

### 3.4.1 Criteria Id

AC-004

### 3.4.2 Scenario

Supervisor with no subordinates attempts to assign an event

### 3.4.3 Scenario Type

Edge_Case

### 3.4.4 Given

A Supervisor with zero direct subordinates is on the 'Create Event' screen

### 3.4.5 When

The Supervisor navigates to the user assignment section

### 3.4.6 Then

The UI displays an informative message, such as 'You have no team members to assign'.

### 3.4.7 Validation Notes

Manually test this scenario by creating a Supervisor user with no subordinates and attempting to create an event.

## 3.5.0 Criteria Id

### 3.5.1 Criteria Id

AC-005

### 3.5.2 Scenario

The list of assignable users is correctly scoped

### 3.5.3 Scenario Type

Security_Condition

### 3.5.4 Given

A Supervisor is logged in and is on the user assignment screen for an event

### 3.5.5 When

The application fetches the list of users to display for assignment

### 3.5.6 Then

The list must only contain users for whom the 'supervisorId' field matches the current Supervisor's user ID.

### 3.5.7 Validation Notes

Verify through Firestore Security Rules testing. An integration test should attempt to fetch users not managed by the Supervisor and assert that the request fails or returns an empty list.

# 4.0.0 User Interface Requirements

## 4.1.0 Ui Elements

- A multi-select list or a list of users with checkboxes.
- A search/filter bar to quickly find users in a large team.
- A 'Save' or 'Confirm' button to finalize assignments.
- An informative message area for edge cases (e.g., no subordinates).

## 4.2.0 User Interactions

- Tapping a user in the list toggles their selection status.
- Typing in the search bar filters the list of subordinates in real-time.
- When editing an event, previously assigned users are pre-selected in the list.

## 4.3.0 Display Requirements

- The list must display the full name of each subordinate.
- A visual indicator (e.g., checkmark) must clearly show who is selected.

## 4.4.0 Accessibility Needs

- The list of users must be navigable using a keyboard.
- Each selectable item (e.g., checkbox and name) must be properly labeled for screen readers (WCAG 2.1 AA).

# 5.0.0 Business Rules

- {'rule_id': 'BR-SUP-01', 'rule_description': 'A Supervisor can only assign events to their own direct subordinates.', 'enforcement_point': 'Backend (Firestore Security Rules) and Frontend (API query).', 'violation_handling': 'The API request to fetch users will be denied by security rules, resulting in an error or an empty list on the client.'}

# 6.0.0 Dependencies

## 6.1.0 Prerequisite Stories

### 6.1.1 Story Id

#### 6.1.1.1 Story Id

US-011

#### 6.1.1.2 Dependency Reason

The system must support the concept of a Supervisor being assigned to a team of subordinates. The 'supervisorId' field on user documents is essential for this story.

### 6.1.2.0 Story Id

#### 6.1.2.1 Story Id

US-052

#### 6.1.2.2 Dependency Reason

This assignment functionality is part of the event creation/editing workflow defined in US-052.

## 6.2.0.0 Technical Dependencies

- Firebase Authentication for identifying the current Supervisor.
- Firestore database for storing user and event data.
- Firestore Security Rules engine for access control.

## 6.3.0.0 Data Dependencies

- Requires user documents in Firestore with a populated 'supervisorId' field.
- Requires an event document to be created or exist to attach assignments to.

## 6.4.0.0 External Dependencies

*No items available*

# 7.0.0.0 Non Functional Requirements

## 7.1.0.0 Performance

- The list of subordinates must load within 2 seconds for a team of up to 100 members on a stable 4G connection.

## 7.2.0.0 Security

- Firestore Security Rules must strictly enforce that a Supervisor can only query for users where `user.supervisorId == request.auth.uid`.
- A Supervisor must not be able to assign an event to a user outside of their management chain or tenant.

## 7.3.0.0 Usability

- The process of selecting multiple users should be intuitive and require minimal taps.

## 7.4.0.0 Accessibility

- The feature must comply with WCAG 2.1 Level AA standards.

## 7.5.0.0 Compatibility

- The feature must function correctly on all supported iOS and Android versions as defined in REQ-DEP-001.

# 8.0.0.0 Implementation Considerations

## 8.1.0.0 Complexity Assessment

Medium

## 8.2.0.0 Complexity Factors

- Implementing robust and thoroughly tested Firestore Security Rules is critical and non-trivial.
- State management for the user selection UI in Flutter, especially for large lists.
- Ensuring the query for subordinates is efficient and indexed correctly in Firestore.

## 8.3.0.0 Technical Risks

- Incorrectly configured Firestore Security Rules could lead to data leakage between teams.
- Poor query performance when a Supervisor manages a very large number of subordinates.

## 8.4.0.0 Integration Points

- Integrates with the Event Creation/Editing screen (US-052).
- The output of this story (updated `assignedUserIds`) is the input for the Subordinate's calendar view (US-057) and push notifications (US-058).

# 9.0.0.0 Testing Requirements

## 9.1.0.0 Testing Types

- Unit
- Widget
- Integration
- Security
- E2E

## 9.2.0.0 Test Scenarios

- Verify a Supervisor can assign and unassign multiple users.
- Verify the UI correctly pre-selects users when editing an event.
- Write specific security rule tests using the Firebase Emulator Suite to confirm a Supervisor cannot access another Supervisor's team members.
- Test the UI with a large list of mock subordinates (e.g., 100+) to check for performance issues.
- E2E test: Supervisor assigns event, then the assigned Subordinate logs in and confirms the event is visible on their calendar.

## 9.3.0.0 Test Data Needs

- A test tenant with at least two Supervisors.
- Supervisor A with multiple subordinates.
- Supervisor B with different subordinates.
- A Supervisor with no subordinates.

## 9.4.0.0 Testing Tools

- Flutter Test framework for unit/widget tests.
- Firebase Local Emulator Suite for integration and security rule testing.
