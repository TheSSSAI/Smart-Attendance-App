"Phase 1: Backend Foundation (Sprints 1-3)","High","6","105","Jest, Firebase Emulator Suite","140","Very High - Enables secure, parallel development and CI/CD quality gates.","4 hours/month","8","CI/CD integration with GitHub Actions.","100% of Firestore Security Rule tests automated. CI build fails on any backend test failure.","Learning curve for Emulator Suite and Jest.","Pair programming, dedicated spike for setup.","Massively de-risks the project by securing the backend and data layer early."
"Phase 2: Core Mobile E2E (Sprints 4-6)","High","6","50","Flutter integration_test","120","High - Automates critical user journeys, reducing manual regression effort.","8 hours/month","12","Device farm integration (e.g., Firebase Test Lab) or dedicated CI runners.","80% of critical path mobile user stories have E2E test coverage.","UI test flakiness, environment setup complexity.","Implement robust test IDs, use mock data from emulators.","Ensures core application functionality remains stable with each release."
"Phase 3: Admin Web & Advanced Testing (Sprints 7-9)","Medium","6","85","Flutter integration_test (Web), JMeter, OWASP ZAP","160","Medium - High effort for performance/security setup, but crucial for production readiness.","10 hours/month","24","Dedicated performance testing environment, security scanning tools in CI.","Performance benchmarks are automatically validated. CI pipeline includes security scans.","Complexity of performance test scripting and analysis.","Start with simple scenarios and iterate. Leverage managed security scanning services.","Ensures application is scalable, secure, and ready for enterprise customers."
